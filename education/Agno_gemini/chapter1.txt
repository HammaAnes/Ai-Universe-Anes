# Challenges of Nation Building

In the years following India's independence on August 14-15, 1947, the nation faced significant hurdles in establishing national unity and securing its territory. This chapter focuses on how independent India successfully addressed these challenges of nation-building within the first decade after 1947.

*   The partition of India, coinciding with freedom, led to widespread violence and displacement, posing a threat to the idea of a secular India.
*   Integrating the princely states into the Indian Union required immediate attention.
*   Redrawing the country's internal boundaries was necessary to fulfill the aspirations of its diverse linguistic communities.

Subsequent chapters will explore other challenges encountered by India during this initial period.

## Challenge for the new nation

On August 14-15, 1947, India achieved independence. Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister, delivered his famous "tryst with destiny" speech that night to the Constituent Assembly.

While the national movement encompassed diverse voices, a common consensus existed on establishing a democratic government for the benefit of all citizens, particularly the poor and socially disadvantaged. With independence attained, the time had come to make the promise of freedom a reality.

India's birth was marked by unprecedented difficulties, including the violence and displacement resulting from the partition of the country in 1947. Despite these challenges, Indian leaders remained focused on addressing the multiple issues confronting the new nation.

## Three Challenges

Independent India faced three main challenges:

1.  **Unity and Diversity:** The immediate challenge was to forge a united nation that respected its diverse society. India's vast size and diversity, with its multitude of languages, cultures, and religions, led to doubts about its ability to remain unified. The partition of the country seemed to confirm these fears. Urgent questions arose regarding India's survival as a unified country, the balance between national unity and regional identities, and the integration of its territory.
2.  **Establishing Democracy:** The second challenge was to establish democracy. The Indian Constitution guaranteed fundamental rights and universal suffrage, and India embraced representative democracy with a parliamentary system. While a democratic constitution was essential, the real challenge was developing democratic practices in accordance with the Constitution.
3.  **Development and Well-being:** Ensuring the development and well-being of all sections of society, not just a select few, was the third challenge. The Constitution emphasized equality and protection for socially disadvantaged groups and religious and cultural communities. The Directive Principles of State Policy outlined welfare goals. The task was to create effective policies for economic development and poverty reduction.

This book explores how independent India responded to these challenges and the extent to which it achieved its constitutional objectives. By examining the politics of India since Independence, it aims to equip readers to form their own conclusions on these critical issues. The initial chapters delve into how the three challenges mentioned above were handled in the early years following Independence.

This chapter will explore the events surrounding independence to provide context to understanding the primary challenge of national unity and security at that time. The chapter continues by looking at how India shaped itself into a nation unified by a shared history and common destiny. In subsequent chapters, the focus shifts to establishing democracy and achieving economic development with equality and justice.

Faiz Ahmed Faiz's Urdu poem *Subh-e-azadi* and Mohammad Ali Jinnah's Presidential Address to the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan (August 11, 1947) express the mixed emotions of the time.

Amrita Pritam's Punjabi poem "Aaj Akhan Waris Shah Nun" and Jawaharlal Nehru's letter to Chief Ministers (October 15, 1947) highlight the pain and the need for civilized treatment of minorities.

## Partition: displacement and rehabilitation

On August 14-15, 1947, the division of British India resulted in the creation of two nations: India and Pakistan. This partition was the outcome of political events detailed in history books. The Muslim League's "two-nation theory" asserted that India comprised two distinct peoples, Hindus and Muslims, leading to the demand for a separate Muslim country, Pakistan. While the Congress party initially opposed this theory, political developments in the 1940s, competition between the Congress and the Muslim League, and the role of the British led to the decision to create Pakistan.

### Process of Partition

The decision to divide "India" into two countries, "India" and "Pakistan," was both painful and complex. The principle of religious majorities was adopted, meaning that areas with Muslim majorities would form Pakistan. However, this principle presented several difficulties. First, Muslim majority areas were not contiguous. Second, not all Muslim majority areas desired to be part of Pakistan. Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan, a leader from the North Western Frontier Province, opposed the two-nation theory, but his views were ignored. Third, the provinces of Punjab and Bengal had large non-Muslim majority areas, leading to their bifurcation based on religious majority at the district level.

The most complex issue was the problem of minorities on both sides of the border. Hindus and Sikhs in Pakistan and Muslims in India found themselves trapped and vulnerable to attack. The scale of the problem was underestimated, and violence quickly escalated. Minorities were forced to flee their homes, often with little notice.

### Consequences of Partition

The year 1947 witnessed one of history's largest, most abrupt, unplanned, and tragic population transfers. Killings and atrocities occurred on both sides of the border, with people being targeted in the name of religion. Cities became divided along communal lines.

People suffered immensely, forced to abandon their homes and seek refuge in temporary camps. They faced unhelpful authorities and were subjected to attacks, killings, and rapes during their journeys. Thousands of women were abducted and forced to convert and marry. Children were separated from their families. Those who crossed the border often found themselves homeless.

Writers, poets, and filmmakers captured the ruthlessness, suffering, and displacement in their works, often referring to Partition as a "division of hearts." Beyond the division of properties, assets, and administration, it also involved the separation of communities that had lived together for generations.

An estimated 80 lakh people were displaced, and between five to ten lakh were killed in Partition-related violence. Beyond the administrative and financial challenges, Partition raised deeper questions. Despite the partition along religious lines, the leaders of the Indian national movement did not believe in the two-nation theory, and the Muslim population in India remained significant. The government of India faced the challenge of treating its Muslim citizens and other religious minorities fairly.

The Muslim League had been formed to protect the interests of Muslims in colonial India and spearheaded the demand for Pakistan. Similarly, Hindu organizations aimed to transform India into a Hindu nation. However, most national movement leaders believed in equal treatment for all religions and envisioned a secular nation, which was enshrined in the Indian Constitution.

Mahatma Gandhi, who did not participate in the Independence Day celebrations on August 15, 1947, worked to promote communal harmony in riot-torn Kolkata. He later moved to Delhi and undertook a fast in January 1948 to ensure the safety and dignity of Muslims in India and to advocate for fair relations between India and Pakistan.

Gandhi's actions were opposed by extremists who blamed him for the situation and wanted India to become a Hindu nation. On January 30, 1948, Nathuram Vinayak Godse assassinated Gandhi, ending his lifelong struggle for truth, non-violence, justice, and tolerance.

Gandhi's death had a profound impact, leading to a reduction in communal violence. The Government of India cracked down on organizations promoting communal hatred.

## Integration of Princely States

British India consisted of British Indian Provinces and Princely States. The British Indian Provinces were under direct British control, while the Princely States, ruled by princes, enjoyed some control over their internal affairs under British supremacy. Princely States constituted a significant portion of the land and population of British India.

### The problem

Before independence, the British announced that their paramountcy over Princely States would lapse, rendering these 565 states legally independent. The British government granted them the freedom to join India or Pakistan or remain independent. This decision, left to the rulers, posed a significant threat to a united India.

Problems arose quickly, with Travancore and Hyderabad declaring their intent to remain independent. The Nawab of Bhopal resisted joining the Constituent Assembly. This raised the possibility of India fragmenting into numerous small countries, undermining the goals of unity, self-determination, and democracy, as most princely states were governed undemocratically.

### Governmentâ€™s approach

The interim government firmly opposed the division of India into small principalities. Sardar Patel, as Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister, played a vital role in negotiating with the rulers and integrating most of them into the Indian Union.

The government's approach was guided by three principles: the people of the princely states wanted to join the Indian Union; the government was willing to grant autonomy to some regions; and the integration of territorial boundaries was of paramount importance.

By August 15, 1947, peaceful negotiations had brought most states contiguous to India into the Indian Union through the "Instrument of Accession." However, Junagadh, Hyderabad, Kashmir, and Manipur proved more challenging. The people of Junagadh voted to join India in a plebiscite. The cases of Hyderabad and Manipur are discussed below.

### Hyderabad

Hyderabad, the largest princely state, was surrounded by Indian territory. Today, parts of the old Hyderabad state are located in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh. The Nizam, its ruler, desired independence and signed a Standstill Agreement with India in November 1947 for a year, pending negotiations.

Meanwhile, a movement against the Nizam's rule gained momentum, particularly among the peasantry in the Telangana region. The Communists and the Hyderabad Congress led the movement. The Nizam responded by unleashing the Razakars, a para-military force, who committed atrocities against the people, particularly non-Muslims.

In September 1948, the Indian army intervened to control the Nizam's forces, leading to his surrender and Hyderabad's accession to India.

### Manipur

Before independence, the Maharaja of Manipur, Bodhachandra Singh, signed the Instrument of Accession with the assurance of maintaining Manipur's internal autonomy. Under public pressure, elections were held in Manipur in June 1948, making it a constitutional monarchy and the first part of India to hold elections based on universal adult franchise.

The Manipur Legislative Assembly was divided over the merger of Manipur with India, with the Congress supporting it and other parties opposing it. In September 1949, the Government of India pressured the Maharaja into signing a Merger Agreement without consulting the Assembly, causing anger and resentment that continue to be felt.

## Reorganisation of State

The process of nation-building continued with the redrawing of internal boundaries to reflect the country's linguistic and cultural diversity while preserving national unity.

During colonial rule, state boundaries were based on administrative convenience or territorial annexation. The national movement rejected these divisions and advocated for linguistic principles in forming states. The Congress party recognized this principle in 1920.

After independence and partition, leaders feared that linguistic states might lead to disruption and disintegration, diverting attention from socio-economic challenges. The central leadership decided to postpone the matter.

This decision was challenged, especially in Telugu-speaking areas of the old Madras province, which included parts of present day Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Karnataka. The Vishalandhra movement demanded a separate Andhra province. The central government's hesitation fueled the movement. The death of Potti Sriramulu, a Congress leader, after a 56-day fast triggered widespread unrest and violence.

In December 1952, the Prime Minister announced the formation of a separate Andhra state.

The formation of Andhra spurred similar demands in other regions. In 1953, the central government appointed a States Reorganisation Commission, which recommended that state boundaries reflect linguistic boundaries. The States Reorganisation Act was passed in 1956, creating 14 states and six union territories.

Despite initial fears, linguistic states did not lead to disintegration but strengthened national unity. They democratized politics and leadership and provided a uniform basis for state boundaries.

The linguistic states underlined the acceptance of diversity and demonstrated that democracy involves recognizing and accepting differences.

### Fast Forward: Creation of new states

Linguistic states were not immediately created. The "bilingual" Bombay state existed until 1960, when Maharashtra and Gujarat were created. In Punjab, statehood came in 1966, when Haryana and Himachal Pradesh were separated.

In 1972, the north-east underwent major reorganization, with Meghalaya, Manipur, and Tripura becoming separate states. Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh followed in 1987, while Nagaland had become a state in 1963.

Language has not remained the sole basis for state reorganization. Sub-regions have demanded separate states based on distinct regional culture or regional imbalance in development. Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, and Jharkhand were created in 2000. Movements for separate states continue in regions like Vidarbha, Harit Pradesh and northern West Bengal.
