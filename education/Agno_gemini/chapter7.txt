# Rise of Popular Movements

People grew impatient in the decades following India's independence. This discontent manifested in various ways. As explored previously, electoral shifts and political crises were one expression. However, diverse social groups also voiced their concerns.

During the **1970s**, groups like women, students, Dalits, and farmers felt their needs were unmet by democratic politics. They united under various social organizations to voice their demands, marking the rise of popular or "new social movements" in Indian politics.

This chapter examines popular movements that arose after the **1970s** to understand:

*   What defines popular movements?
*   Which segments of Indian society have these movements mobilized?
*   What are the primary goals of these movements?
*   What is their role within a democratic system like India's?

## Nature of Popular Movements

The opening image shows villagers embracing trees. This depicts collective action from **early 1973** in Uttarakhand, where villagers protested commercial logging permitted by the government. Their tactic, hugging trees, was a novel form of protest and the beginning of the Chipko movement, a well-known environmental movement.

## Chipko Movement

This movement began in Uttarakhand when the forest department denied villagers permission to fell ash trees for agricultural tools, but granted the same land to a sports manufacturer. This sparked protests that spread throughout the region. The movement addressed broader ecological and economic exploitation issues. Villagers demanded control over natural resources (land, water, forests) for local communities and sought an end to contracts with outsiders. They wanted low-cost materials for small industries and development without ecological disruption. The movement also addressed economic issues for landless forest workers, demanding minimum wage guarantees.

Women played a significant role in the Chipko agitation. They campaigned against alcoholism (often supplied by forest contractors) and broadened the movement's agenda to encompass other social concerns. The government eventually imposed a 15-year ban on tree felling in the Himalayan region to restore the green cover. The Chipko movement, originating from a single issue, became a symbol of emerging popular movements across India in the **1970s** and later.

## Party-Based Movements

Popular movements can be social or political, often overlapping. The nationalist movement was primarily political. However, discussions on social and economic issues during the colonial period led to independent social movements, such as anti-caste movements, kisan sabhas, and trade unions in the early 20th century. These movements highlighted underlying social conflicts.

Some movements continued post-independence. Trade unions had a strong presence among industrial workers in major cities. Major political parties established their own trade unions. Peasants in Telangana (Andhra Pradesh) organized agitations under Communist party leadership, demanding land redistribution in the early years of independence. Peasants and agricultural laborers in parts of Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, and nearby areas continued agitations under Marxist-Leninist workers (Naxalites). These movements focused on economic injustice and inequality.

These movements did not formally participate in elections but maintained connections with political parties through individual and organizational associations. This ensured better representation of diverse social sections in party politics.

## Non-Party Movements

During the **1970s** and **1980s**, many became disillusioned with political parties, sparked by the failure of the Janata experiment and subsequent instability. This disillusionment extended to the state's economic policies. The planned development model adopted post-independence aimed for growth and distribution. Despite economic growth in some sectors during the first 20 years of independence, poverty and inequality persisted. Economic growth benefits were unevenly distributed, and existing inequalities (caste, gender) complicated poverty issues. A gap also existed between urban-industrial and rural-agrarian sectors, leading to a sense of injustice.

Many politically active groups lost faith in democratic institutions and electoral politics. They chose to engage in mass mobilization outside party politics. Students and young activists organized marginalized sections like Dalits and Adivasis. Middle-class activists started service organizations and constructive programs for the rural poor, often known as voluntary organizations or voluntary sector organizations.

These organizations remained outside party politics, not contesting elections or supporting any single party. Believing in politics but not through parties, they were called "non-party political formations." They hoped direct citizen participation would be more effective in resolving local issues and reforming democratic government.

Such voluntary organizations continue work in rural and urban areas. However, their nature has changed, with many now funded by external agencies. This weakens the ideal of local initiatives.

## Dalit Panthers

Marathi Dalit poets wrote many poems during the **1970s**.  These poems expressed anguish over the continued struggles of Dalit communities even after two decades of independence.  These works also expressed hope for a future shaped by Dalit groups themselves. These Dalit liberation writings are largely inspired by Dr. Ambedkar's vision of socio-economic change.

### Origins

By the early **1970s**, first-generation Dalit graduates, particularly in city slums, began asserting themselves. Dalit Panthers, a militant organization of Dalit youth, formed in Maharashtra in **1972**. Post-independence, Dalit groups primarily fought caste-based inequalities and material injustices, despite constitutional guarantees. They prominently demanded effective implementation of reservations and other social justice policies.

Despite the abolition of untouchability and related laws passed in the **1960s** and **1970s**, social discrimination and violence persisted. Dalit settlements remained separate, access to water was denied, Dalit women were dishonored, and collective atrocities occurred over caste pride. Legal mechanisms were inadequate to stop the economic and social oppression of Dalits. Dalit-supported political parties, like the Republican Party of India, remained electorally marginalized, often requiring alliances and facing splits. Therefore, the Dalit Panthers resorted to mass action to assert Dalit rights.

### Activities

Dalit Panthers focused on fighting increasing atrocities against Dalits. Their sustained agitations led to the government passing a comprehensive law in **1989** that provided for rigorous punishment for such acts. The Panthers' broader agenda was to destroy the caste system and build an organization of oppressed sections (landless peasants, urban workers, Dalits).

The movement provided a platform for Dalit educated youth to express creativity as protest. Dalit writers protested caste brutalities in autobiographies and literary works, sending shockwaves through Marathi literature, broadening its scope, and initiating cultural contestations. After the Emergency period, Dalit Panthers got involved in electoral compromises and underwent splits, leading to its decline. Organizations like the Backward and Minority Communities’ Employees Federation (BAMCEF) emerged.

## Bharatiya Kisan Union

Social discontent in the **1970s** extended to sections that had partially benefited from development. Agrarian struggles in the **1980s** exemplify this, where better-off farmers protested state policies.

### Growth

In January **1988**, about twenty thousand farmers gathered in Meerut (Uttar Pradesh), protesting electricity rate increases. They camped outside the district collector’s office for three weeks until their demands were met. This disciplined agitation, supplied by nearby villages, showcased rural power. The farmers were members of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), a farmers' organization from western Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. The BKU was a leading organization in the farmers’ movement of the eighties.

Farmers in Haryana, Punjab, and western Uttar Pradesh had benefited from the "green revolution" policies of the late **1960s**. Sugar and wheat became main cash crops. The cash crop market faced a crisis in the mid-**1980s** due to economic liberalization. The BKU demanded higher government floor prices for sugarcane and wheat, abolition of restrictions on interstate movement of farm produce, guaranteed electricity supply at reasonable rates, waiving of loan repayments, and government pensions for farmers.

Similar demands were made by other farmers’ organizations. Shetkari Sanghatana of Maharashtra declared the farmers’ movement a war of Bharat (rural agrarian sector) against India (urban industrial sector).

### Characteristics

BKU activities included rallies, demonstrations, sit-ins, and jail bharo (courting imprisonment) agitations. These protests involved tens of thousands of farmers from western Uttar Pradesh and adjoining regions. Throughout the **1980s**, the BKU organized massive rallies in district headquarters and the national capital.  These mobilizations also used caste linkages. Most BKU members belonged to a single community. The organization used traditional caste panchayats to unite them over economic issues. Despite lacking a formal organization, the BKU sustained itself through clan networks. Funds, resources, and activities were mobilized through these networks.

Until the early **1990s**, the BKU distanced itself from political parties, operating as a pressure group with its large numbers. The organization, along with other farmers' organizations, managed to get some economic demands accepted. The farmers’ movement became one of the most successful social movements of the ’eighties in this respect, due to its members' political bargaining powers. The movement was mainly active in prosperous states. Unlike subsistence farmers, BKU members grew cash crops for the market. Similar to the BKU, farmers’ organizations across states recruited members from communities that dominated regional electoral politics. Shetkari Sanghatana of Maharashtra and Rayata Sangha of Karnataka are examples.

## National Fish Workers’ Forum

The Indian fishers constitute the second largest fishing population globally. Hundreds of thousands of families, mainly indigenous fishermen communities, are engaged in fishing along the coastal areas. These fish workers' lives were threatened when the government permitted mechanized trawlers and technologies like bottom trawling for large-scale harvest of fish. Throughout the **1970s** and **1980s**, local fish workers’ organizations fought with the State governments over livelihood issues. Fisheries being a State subject, the fish workers were mostly mobilized at the regional level.

With economic liberalization policies in the mid-**1980s**, these organizations united on a national level platform – the NFF or National Fishworkers’ Forum. Fish workers from Kerala took the main responsibility of mobilizing fellow workers, including women workers, from other States. NFF consolidated when it fought its first legal battle with the Union government in **1991**. This was about the government’s deep sea fishing policy that opened up India’s waters to large commercial vessels. Throughout the nineties the NFF fought various legal and public battles with the government to protect the interests of those who rely on fishing for subsistence rather than those who invest in the sector for profit. In July **2002**, NFF called for a nationwide strike to oppose the move of the government to issue licenses to foreign trawlers. The NFF joined hands with organizations worldwide for protecting ecology and protecting lives of the fish workers.

## Anti-Arrack Movement

While the BKU mobilized farmers in the north, a different mobilization took shape in Andhra Pradesh: women demanding a ban on alcohol sales in their neighborhoods.

Stories appeared in the Telugu press almost daily during September and October **1992**. Rural women in remote villages fought against alcoholism, mafias, and the government. These agitations shaped the anti-arrack movement.

### Origins

In a village in Nellore district, Andhra Pradesh, women enrolled in the Adult Literacy Drive in the early **1990s**. They complained of increased consumption of locally brewed alcohol (arrack) by men in their families. Alcoholism had taken root, ruining physical and mental health, and affecting the rural economy. Indebtedness grew, men were absent from jobs, and alcohol contractors engaged in crime to secure their monopoly. Women suffered the most, facing collapsed family economies and violence from male family members.

Women in Nellore protested and forced wine shop closures. The news spread, inspiring women in about 5000 villages to pass resolutions for prohibition and send them to the District Collector. The arrack auctions in Nellore district were postponed 17 times. This movement slowly spread all over the State.

### Linkages

The slogan of the anti-arrack movement was a simple demand — prohibition on the sale of arrack. But this demand touched upon larger social, economic, and political issues of the region that affected women’s life. A close nexus between crime and politics was established around the business of arrack. The State government collected huge revenues by way of taxes imposed on the sale of arrack and was therefore not willing to impose a ban. Groups of local women tried to address these complex issues in their agitation against arrack. They also openly discussed the issue of domestic violence. Their movement, for the first time, provided a platform to discuss private issues of domestic violence. Thus, the anti-arrack movement also became part of the women’s movement.

Earlier, women’s groups working on issues of domestic violence, the custom of dowry, sexual abuse at work and public places were active mainly among urban middle class women in different parts of the country. During the **1980s**, the women’s movement focused on issues of sexual violence against women, within the family and outside. These groups ran a campaign against the system of dowry and demanded personal and property laws based on the norms of gender equality.

These campaigns contributed a great deal in increasing overall social awareness about women’s questions. As a result the movement made demands of equal representation to women in politics during the nineties. Women have received reservations in local-level political offices through the 73rd and 74th amendments, and similar reservations in State and Central legislatures have also been proposed.

## Narmada Bachao Aandolan

The Narmada Bachao Aandolan opposed the Sardar Sarovar Project in the early 1980s, which involved the construction of 30 large dams, 135 medium-sized dams, and around 3,000 small dams on the Narmada River and its tributaries across Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and Maharashtra.

### Sardar Sarovar Project

The project, proponents claimed, would benefit Gujarat and neighboring states with drinking water, irrigation, electricity, and increased agricultural production. Effective flood and drought control were also linked to the dam's success. Construction of the dam would submerge 245 villages and require relocation of around two and a half lakh people. Local activist groups first raised relocation and rehabilitation issues. Around **1988-89**, the issues crystallized under the banner of the NBA – a loose collective of local voluntary organizations.

### Debates and Struggles

From its inception, the NBA linked its opposition to larger issues concerning developmental projects, the country's development model, and public interest in a democracy. It demanded a cost-benefit analysis of major developmental projects, including social costs: resettlement, loss of livelihood and culture, and ecological depletion.

Initially, the movement demanded proper rehabilitation for those affected by the project. It also questioned decision-making processes for mega-scale projects. The NBA insisted on community involvement and effective control over natural resources. The movement also asked why, in a democracy, some people should sacrifice for others. All these considerations led the NBA to shift from its initial demand for rehabilitation to its position of total opposition to the dam.

The movement met opposition in benefiting states, especially Gujarat. At the same time, the point about right to rehabilitation has been now recognized by the government and the judiciary. A comprehensive National Rehabilitation Policy formed by the government in 2003 can be seen as an achievement of the movements like the NBA. However, critics argued that its demand to stop construction obstructed development and denied access to water and economic development for many. The Supreme Court upheld the government's decision to go ahead with the construction of the dam while also instructing to ensure proper rehabilitation.

The Narmada Bachao Aandolan continued for over twenty years, employing democratic strategies like appeals to the judiciary, international support, public rallies, and Satyagraha. The movement could not garner much support among the mainstream political parties. By the end of the nineties, NBA became part of a larger alliance of people’s movements that are involved in struggles for similar issues in different regions of the country.

## Lessons from Popular Movements

The history of these movements helps understand democratic politics. Non-party movements are integral to democratic politics, rectifying issues in party politics. They represented new social groups whose grievances were not addressed electorally. Popular movements ensured effective representation, reducing social conflict and disaffection. They suggested new forms of participation, broadening the idea of democracy.

Critics argue that collective actions disrupt government, delay decisions, and destabilize routines. However, such assertive action is a result of routine democratic processes not accommodating the voices of marginalized groups.

Movements are not just about assertions; they involve a gradual process of people with similar problems coming together. They also make people aware of their rights and expectations from democratic institutions, contributing to the expansion of democracy.

Yet the impact of these movements on public policies seems limited because many focus on single issues and represent only one section of society. Democratic politics requires a broad alliance of disadvantaged groups, which is not shaping under these movements. Political parties seem unable to bring together different sectional interests or take up issues of marginal social groups. The movements that take up these issues operate in a very restrictive manner. The relationship between popular movements and political parties has grown weaker over the years, creating a vacuum in politics. This has become a major problem in Indian politics in recent years.

## Movement for Right to Information

The movement for Right to Information (RTI) is one of the few recent examples of a movement that did succeed in getting the state to accept its major demand. The movement started in **1990**, when the Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan (MKSS) in Rajasthan took the initiative in demanding records of famine relief work and accounts of labourers. The demand was first raised in Bhim Tehsil in a very backward region of Rajasthan. In **1994** and **1996**, the MKSS organized Jan Sunwais or Public Hearings, where the administration was asked to explain its stand in public.

The movement had a small success when they could force an amendment in the Rajasthan Panchayati Raj Act to permit the public to procure certified copies of documents held by the Panchayats. In **1996** MKSS formed National Council for People’s Right to Information in Delhi to raise RTI to the status of a national campaign. In 2002, a weak Freedom of Information Act was legislated but never came into force. In 2004 RTI Bill was tabled and received presidential assent in June 2005.
