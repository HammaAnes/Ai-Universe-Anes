# Regional Aspirations: Region and the Nation

Chapter 1 of this book explored the process of nation-building in India during the first decade post-independence. However, nation-building is a continuous process, not a one-time achievement. Over time, new challenges emerged, while some older problems remained unresolved.

As India's democratic system evolved, different regions began articulating their desires for autonomy. Sometimes, these aspirations went beyond the framework of the Indian Union. These situations often led to prolonged struggles, including assertive and even armed actions by various groups.

This new challenge became particularly prominent in the 1980s, following the end of the Janata experiment and a period of relative political stability at the center. The 1980s are notable for significant conflicts and agreements in regions like Assam, Punjab, Mizoram, and Jammu & Kashmir. This chapter examines these cases to address key questions:

*   What factors contribute to tensions arising from regional aspirations?
*   How has the Indian state responded to these challenges and tensions?
*   What difficulties arise in balancing democratic rights and national unity?
*   What lessons can be learned for achieving unity with diversity in a democracy?

## Indian Approach

Our study of the Indian Constitution and nation-building reveals a core principle: the Indian nation respects the rights of various regions and linguistic groups to preserve their cultures. The goal was to create a united society that retained its diverse cultural identities. Indian nationalism aimed to balance unity and diversity, ensuring the nation didn't negate regional identities. This contrasts with many European countries, where cultural diversity was often viewed as a threat.

India adopted a democratic approach to diversity, allowing political expression of regional aspirations without labeling them as anti-national. This democratic framework allows parties to address people based on regional identity, aspirations, and specific issues, which strengthens regional aspirations. At the same time, democratic politics also makes sure that regional issues and problems get adequate attention and are accommodated in the policy making process. This arrangement can lead to conflicts, as concern for national unity may overshadow regional needs, or vice versa. Political conflicts over regional power, rights, and separate existence are common in nations that value diversity while striving for unity.

## Areas of Tension

Chapter 1 highlighted the challenges India faced immediately after independence, such as Partition, displacement, integrating princely states, and reorganizing states. Many observers predicted India wouldn't remain unified. Soon after independence, the issue of Jammu and Kashmir arose, involving both conflict with Pakistan and the political aspirations of Kashmiris. Similarly, some parts of the Northeast lacked consensus on being part of India. Nagaland and Mizoram saw strong movements demanding separation. Some groups in the Dravidian movement briefly considered a separate country.

These events were followed by mass agitations for linguistic states in regions like Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Gujarat. Protests against making Hindi the official language occurred in parts of southern India, particularly Tamil Nadu, while pro-Hindi agitations in the north demanded immediate implementation. From the late 1950s, Punjabi speakers agitated for a separate state, leading to the creation of Punjab and Haryana in 1966. Later, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, and Jharkhand were created, demonstrating how internal boundaries were redrawn to address diversity.

However, this didn't solve all problems permanently. Challenges persisted in regions like Kashmir and Nagaland. New challenges emerged in Punjab, Assam, and Mizoram. Studying these cases, including earlier difficulties in nation-building, offers valuable lessons for understanding both India's past and its future.

## Jammu and Kashmir

The violence in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) has resulted in loss of life and displacement. The 'Kashmir issue' is often viewed as a conflict between India and Pakistan, but the state's political situation is multifaceted.

J&K comprises three socio-political regions: Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh. The Kashmir valley, primarily Kashmiri-speaking Muslims with a small Hindu minority, forms the heart of the Kashmir region. Jammu is a mix of Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, and various languages. Ladakh is mountainous, sparsely populated, and equally divided between Buddhists and Muslims.

The 'Kashmir issue' involves external and internal dimensions. It includes Kashmiri identity (Kashmiriyat) and aspirations for political autonomy.

### Roots of the Problem

Before 1947, J&K was a princely state. Its Hindu ruler, Hari Singh, initially sought independence, negotiating with both India and Pakistan. Pakistani leaders believed Kashmir 'belonged' to Pakistan due to its Muslim majority. However, Kashmiris primarily identified as Kashmiris. The popular movement led by Sheikh Abdullah of the National Conference opposed joining Pakistan but wanted to remove the Maharaja. The National Conference was a secular organization closely associated with Congress, and Sheikh Abdullah was a friend of nationalist leaders like Nehru.

In October 1947, Pakistan sent tribal infiltrators to capture Kashmir, prompting the Maharaja to request Indian military assistance. India provided support and drove back the infiltrators after the Maharaja signed the 'Instrument of Accession'. It was agreed that the people of J&K would determine their future after normalization. Sheikh Abdullah became the Prime Minister of J&K (the head of the government in the State was then called Prime Minister) in March 1948. India agreed to maintain the autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir.

### External and Internal Disputes

Since then, J&K's politics has remained controversial due to both external and internal reasons. Externally, Pakistan has consistently claimed Kashmir. Pakistan sponsored a tribal invasion in 1947, resulting in a portion of the state coming under Pakistani control, which India considers an illegal occupation, while Pakistan calls it 'Azad Kashmir'. Kashmir has remained a point of conflict between India and Pakistan since 1947.

Internally, disputes exist regarding Kashmir's status within India. Article 370 of the Constitution grants J&K special status, providing greater autonomy compared to other states. The State has its own Constitution. All provisions of the Indian Constitution are not applicable to the State. Laws passed by the Parliament apply to J&K only if the State agrees. This special status has evoked contrasting reactions. Some outside J&K believe Article 370 hinders full integration and should be revoked, making J&K like any other state.

However, many Kashmiris feel Article 370's autonomy is insufficient. They express three main grievances:

1.  The promise of a plebiscite after normalization hasn't been fulfilled, fueling demands for one.
2.  The guaranteed special federal status under Article 370 has been eroded in practice, leading to calls for restored or greater autonomy.
3.  Democracy isn't as firmly institutionalized in J&K as in the rest of India.

### Politics Since 1948

After becoming Prime Minister, Sheikh Abdullah initiated land reforms benefiting ordinary people. However, differences arose between him and the central government regarding Kashmir's status. He was dismissed in 1953 and detained for years. His successors lacked popular support and relied on central support. Elections were marred by allegations of malpractices and rigging.

From 1953 to 1974, the Congress party heavily influenced the state's politics. A truncated National Conference (without Sheikh Abdullah) remained in power with Congress's support before merging with Congress, giving them direct control. Attempts were made to reach agreements with Sheikh Abdullah. In 1974, Indira Gandhi reached an agreement with Sheikh Abdullah, and he became Chief Minister, reviving the National Conference, which won a majority in the 1977 assembly elections.

Sheikh Abdullah died in 1982, and his son, Farooq Abdullah, became Chief Minister. He was soon dismissed by the Governor, and a breakaway faction of the National Conference briefly held power.

The dismissal of Farooq Abdullah's government due to central intervention created resentment in Kashmir. The confidence in democratic processes established after the Indira Gandhi-Sheikh Abdullah accord was undermined. The feeling that the Centre was intervening in politics of the State was further strengthened when the National Conference in 1986 agreed to have an electoral alliance with the Congress, the ruling party in the Centre.

### Insurgency and After

In this environment, the 1987 Assembly election took place. The official results showed a massive victory for the National Conference – Congress alliance and Farooq Abdullah returned as Chief Minister.  But it was widely believed that the results did not reflect popular choice, and that the entire election process was rigged. A popular resentment had already been brewing in the State against the inefficient administration since early 1980s. This was now augmented by the commonly prevailing feeling that democratic processes were being undermined at the behest of the Centre. This generated a political crisis in Kashmir which became severe with the rise of insurgency.

By 1989, the State had come in the grip of a militant movement mobilised around the cause of a separate Kashmiri nation. The insurgents got moral, material and military support from Pakistan. For a number of years the State was under President’s rule and effectively under the control of the armed forces. Throughout the period from 1990, Jammu and Kashmir experienced violence at the hands of the insurgents and through army action. Assembly elections in the State were held only in 1996 in which the National Conference led by Farooq Abdullah came to power with a demand for regional autonomy for Jammu and Kashmir.  J&K experienced a very fair election in 2002. The National Conference failed to win a majority and was replaced by People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and Congress coalition government.

### Separatism and Beyond

Separatist politics in Kashmir since 1989 has taken different forms. Some separatists want a separate Kashmiri nation, independent of India and Pakistan. Others want Kashmir to merge with Pakistan. A third group seeks greater autonomy within India. Autonomy also appeals to people in Jammu and Ladakh, who often complain of neglect and backwardness, leading to demands for intra-state autonomy.

The initial popular support for militancy has waned, replaced by a desire for peace. The Centre has begun negotiations with separatist groups, with most now seeking to renegotiate the State's relationship with India rather than demanding complete separation.

J&K exemplifies a plural society with diverse religious, cultural, linguistic, and ethnic groups, as well as divergent political aspirations. Despite these diversities and the continued conflict, the State's plural and secular culture has largely remained intact.

## Punjab

The 1980s also saw significant developments in Punjab. The state's social composition changed with Partition and the creation of Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. While the rest of the country was reorganized on linguistic lines in 1950s, Punjab had to wait till 1966 for the creation of a Punjabi speaking State. The Akali Dal, which was formed in 1920 as the political wing of the Sikhs, had led the movement for the formation of a ‘Punjabi suba’. The Sikhs are now a majority in the truncated State of Punjab.

### Political Context

After the reorganisation, the Akalis came to power in 1967 and then in 1977. On both the occasions it was a coalition government. The Akalis discovered that despite the redrawing of the boundaries, their political position remained precarious. Firstly, their government was dismissed by the Centre mid-way through its term. Secondly, they did not enjoy strong support among the Hindus. Thirdly, the Sikh community, like all other religious communities, was internally differentiated on caste and class lines. The Congress got more support among the Dalits, whether Hindu or Sikh, than the Akalis.

It was in this context that during the 1970s a section of Akalis began to demand political autonomy for the region. This was reflected in a resolution passed at their conference at Anandpur Sahib in 1973. The Anandpur Sahib Resolution asserted regional autonomy and wanted to redefine centre-state relationship in the country. The resolution also spoke of the aspirations of the Sikh qaum (community or nation) and declared its goal as attaining the bolbala (dominance or hegemony) of the Sikhs. The Resolution was a plea for strengthening federalism, but it could also be interpreted as a plea for a separate Sikh nation.

The Resolution had a limited appeal among the Sikh masses. A few years later, after the Akali government had been dismissed in 1980, the Akali Dal launched a movement on the question of the distribution of water between Punjab and its neighbouring States. A section of the religious leaders raised the question of autonomous Sikh identity. The more extreme elements started advocating secession from India and the creation of ‘Khalistan’.

### Cycle of Violence

Soon, the leadership of the movement passed from the moderate Akalis to the extremist elements and took the form of armed insurgency. These militants made their headquarters inside the Sikh holy shrine, the Golden Temple in Amritsar, and turned it into an armed fortress. In June 1984, the Government of India carried out ‘Operation Blue Star’, code name for army action in the Golden Temple. In this operation, the Government could successfully flush out the militants, but it also damaged the historic temple and deeply hurt the sentiments of the Sikhs. A large proportion of Sikhs in India and abroad saw the military operation as an attack on their faith and this gave further impetus to militant and extremist groups.

Still more tragic turn of events complicated the Punjab problem further. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated on 31 October 1984 outside her residence by her bodyguards. Both the assassins were Sikhs and wanted to take revenge for Operation Bluestar. While the entire country was shocked by this development, in Delhi and in many parts of northern India violence broke out against the Sikh community. The violence against the Sikhs continued for almost a week. More than two thousand Sikhs were killed in the national capital, the area worst affected by this violence. Hundreds of Sikhs were killed in other parts of the country, especially in places like Kanpur, Bokaro and Chas. Many Sikh families lost their male members and thus suffered great emotional and heavy financial loss. What hurt the Sikhs most was that the government took a long time in restoring normalcy and that the perpetrators of this violence were not effectively punished. Twenty years later, speaking in the Parliament in 2005, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh expressed regret over these killings and apologised to the nation for the anti-Sikh violence.

### Road to Peace

After coming to power following the election in 1984, the new Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi initiated a dialogue with moderate Akali leaders. In July 1985, he reached an agreement with Harchand Singh Longowal, then the President of the Akali Dal. This agreement, known as the Rajiv Gandhi - Longowal Accord or the Punjab Accord, was a step towards bringing normalcy to Punjab. It was agreed that Chandigarh would be transferred to Punjab, a separate commission would be appointed to resolve the border dispute between Punjab and Haryana, and a tribunal would be set up to decide the sharing of Ravi-Beas river water among Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. The agreement also provided for compensation to and better treatment of those affected by the militancy in Punjab and the withdrawal of the application of Armed Forces Special Powers Act in Punjab.

However, peace did not come easily or immediately. The cycle of violence continued nearly for a decade. Militancy and counter insurgency violence led to excesses by the police and violations of human rights. Politically, it led to fragmentation of the Akali Dal. The central government had to impose President’s rule in the State and the normal electoral and political process was suspended. It was not easy to restore the political process in the atmosphere of suspicion and violence. When elections were held in Punjab in 1992, only 24 per cent of the electors tuned out to vote.

Militancy was eventually eradicated by the security forces. But the losses incurred by the people of Punjab – Sikhs and Hindus alike – were enormous. Peace returned to Punjab by the middle of 1990s. The alliance of Akali Dal (Badal) and the BJP scored a major victory in1997, in the first normal elections in the State in the post-militancy era. The State is once again preoccupied with questions of economic development and social change. Though religious identities continue to be important for the people, politics has gradually moved back along secular lines.

## The North-East

In the North-East, regional aspirations reached a turning point in 1980s. This region now consists of seven States, also referred to as the ‘seven sisters’. The region has only 4 per cent of the country’s population but about twice as much share of its area. A small corridor of about 22 kilometers connects the region to the rest of the country. Otherwise the region shares boundaries with China, Myanmar and Bangladesh and serves as India’s gateway to South East Asia.

The region has witnessed a lot of change since 1947. Tripura, Manipur and Khasi Hills of Meghalaya were erstwhile Princely States which merged with India after Independence. The entire region of North-East has undergone considerable political reorganisation. Nagaland State was created in 1963; Manipur, Tripura and Meghalaya in 1972 while Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh became separate States only in 1987. The Partition of India in 1947 had reduced the North-East to a land locked region and affected its economy. Cut off from the rest of India, the region suffered neglect in developmental terms. Its politics too remained insulated. At the same time, most States in this region underwent major demographic changes due to influx of migrants from neighbouring States and countries.

The isolation of the region, its complex social character and its backwardness compared to other parts of the country have all resulted in the complicated set of demands from different states of the North-East. The vast international border and weak communication between the North-East and the rest of India have further added to the delicate nature of politics there. Three issues dominate the politics of North-East: demands for autonomy, movements for secession, and opposition to ‘outsiders’. Major initiatives on the first issue in the 1970s set the stage for some dramatic developments on the second and the third in the 1980s.

### Demands for Autonomy

At independence the entire region except Manipur and Tripura comprised the State of Assam. Demands for political autonomy arose when the non-Assamese felt that the Assam government was imposing Assamese language on them. There were opposition and protest riots throughout the State. Leaders of the major tribal communities wanted to separate from Assam. They formed the Eastern India Tribal Union which later transformed into a more comprehensive All Party Hill Leaders Conference in 1960. They demanded a tribal State to be carved out of Assam. Finally instead of one tribal State, several States got carved out of Assam. At different points of time the Central Government had to create Meghalaya, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh out of Assam. Tripura and Manipur were upgraded into States too.

The reorganisation of the North-East was completed by 1972. But this was not the end of autonomy demands in this region. In Assam, for example, communities like the Bodos, Karbis and Dimasas wanted separate States. They worked for this demand by mobilising public opinion and popular movement as well as through insurgency. Often the same area was claimed by more than one community. It was not possible to go on making smaller and yet smaller States. Therefore, some other provisions of our federal set up were used to satisfy their autonomy demands while remaining in Assam. Karbis and Dimasas have been granted autonomy under District Councils while Bodos were recently granted Autonomous Council.

### Secessionist Movements

Demands for autonomy were easier to respond to, for these involved using the various provisions in the Constitution for accommodation of diversities. It was much more difficult when some groups demanded a separate country, not in momentary anger but consistently as a principled position. The country’s leadership faced this problem for a very long time in at least two States in the North-East. A comparison of these two cases offers us a lesson in democratic politics.

After Independence, the Mizo Hills area was made an autonomous district within Assam. Some Mizos believed that they were never a part of British India and therefore did not belong to the Indian union. But the movement for secession gained popular support after the Assam government failed to respond adequately to the great famine of 1959 in Mizo hills. The Mizos’ anger led to the formation of the Mizo National Front (MNF) under the leadership of Laldenga.

In 1966 the MNF started an armed campaign for independence. Thus, started a two decade long battle between Mizo insurgents and the Indian army. The MNF fought a guerilla war, got support from Pakistani government and secured shelter in the then East Pakistan. The Indian security forces countered it with a series of repressive measures of which the common people were the victims. At one point even Air Force was used. These measures caused more anger and alienation among the people.

At the end of two decades of insurgency everyone was a loser. This is where maturity of the political leadership at both ends made a difference. Laldenga came back from exile in Pakistan and started negotiations with the Indian government. Rajiv Gandhi steered these negotiations to a positive conclusion. In 1986 a peace agreement was signed between Rajiv Gandhi and Laldenga. As per this accord Mizoram was granted full-fledged statehood with special powers and the MNF agreed to give up secessionist struggle. Laldenga took over as the Chief Minister. This accord proved a turning point in the history of Mizoram. Today, Mizoram is one of the most peaceful places in the region and has taken big strides in literacy and development.

The story of Nagaland is similar to Mizoram, except that it started much earlier and has not yet had such a happy ending. Led by Angami Zaphu Phizo, a section of the Nagas declared independence from India way back in 1951. Phizo turned down many offers of negotiated settlement. The Naga National Council launched an armed struggle for sovereignty of Nagas. After a period of violent insurgency a section of the Nagas signed an agreement with the Government of India but this was not acceptable to other rebels. The problem in Nagaland still awaits a final resolution.

### Movements Against Outsiders

The large scale migration into the North-East gave rise to a special kind of problem that pitted the ‘local’ communities against people who were seen as ‘outsiders’ or migrants. These latecomers, either from India or abroad are seen as encroachers on scarce resources like land and potential competitors to employment opportunities and political power. This issue has taken political and sometimes violent form in many States of the North-East.

The Assam Movement from 1979 to 1985 is the best example of such movements against ‘outsiders’. The Assamese suspected that there were huge numbers of illegal Bengali Muslim settlers from Bangladesh. They felt that unless these foreign nationals are detected and deported they would reduce the indigenous Assamese into a minority. There were other economic issues too. There was widespread poverty and unemployment in Assam despite the existence of natural resources like oil, tea and coal. It was felt that these were drained out of the State without any commensurate benefit to the people.

In 1979 the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU), a students’ group not affiliated to any party, led an anti-foreigner movement. The movement was against illegal migrations, against domination of Bengalis and other outsiders, and against faulty voters’ register that included the names of lakhs of immigrants. The movement demanded that all outsiders who had entered the State after 1951 should be sent back. The agitation followed many novel methods and mobilised all sections of Assamese people, drawing support across the State. It also involved many tragic and violent incidents leading to loss of property and human lives. The movement also tried to blockade the movement of trains and the supply of oil from Assam to refineries in Bihar.

Eventually after six years of turmoil, the Rajiv Gandhi-led government entered into negotiations with the AASU leaders, leading to the signing of an accord in 1985. According to this agreement those foreigners who migrated into Assam during and after Bangladesh war and since, were to be identified and deported. With the successful completion of the movement, the AASU and the Asom Gana Sangram Parishad organised themselves as a regional political party called Asom Gana Parishad (AGP). It came to power in 1985 with the promise of resolving the foreign national problem as well as to build a ‘Golden Assam’.

Assam accord brought peace and changed the face of politics in Assam, but it did not solve the problem of immigration. The issue of the ‘outsiders’ continues to be a live issue in the politics of Assam and many other places in the North-East. This problem is particularly acute, for example, in Tripura as the original inhabitants have been reduced to being a minority in their own land. The same feeling informs the hostility of the local population to Chakma refugees in Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh.

## Accommodation and National Integration

These cases show that some issues of national integration remain unresolved even after six decades of Independence. Regional aspirations, ranging from demands for statehood and economic development to autonomy and separation, continue to emerge. The period since 1980 accentuated these tensions and tested the capacity of democratic politics to accommodate the demands of diverse sections of the society. What lessons can we draw from these examples?

The first and most basic lesson is that regional aspirations are inherent in democratic politics. Their expression is not abnormal. Even smaller countries like the UK face regional aspirations in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Spain faces secessionist movements from the Basques, as does Sri Lanka from the Tamils. A diverse democracy like India must regularly address regional aspirations, making nation-building an ongoing process.

The second lesson is that democratic negotiations, not suppression, are the best way to address regional aspirations. Look at the situation in the eighties – militancy had erupted in Punjab; problems were persisting in the North-East; students in Assam were agitating; Kashmir valley was on the boil. Instead of treating these as simple law and order problems, the Government of India reached negotiated settlement with regional movements. This produced a reconciliation which reduced the tensions existing in many regions. The example of Mizoram shows how political settlement can resolve the problem of separatism effectively.

The third lesson highlights the importance of power-sharing. A formal democratic structure alone isn't sufficient. Groups and parties from the region need a share in power at the state level. Similarly, autonomy at the regional level isn't enough. The regions collectively form the nation, so they must participate in shaping its destiny. Denying regions a voice in national decision-making can breed injustice and alienation.

The fourth lesson is that economic disparities fuel regional discrimination. Regional imbalance is a fact of India’s development experience. Naturally, the backward states or backward regions in some states feel that their backwardness should be addressed on priority basis and that the policies of the Indian government have caused this imbalance. If some states remain poor and others develop rapidly, it leads to regional imbalances and inter-regional migrations.

Finally, these cases show us the wisdom of the makers of our Constitution in dealing with questions of diversity. The federal system adopted by India is a flexible arrangement. While most of the states have equal powers, there are special provisions for some states like J&K and the states in the North-East. The Sixth Schedule of the Constitution allows different tribes complete autonomy of preserving their practices and customary laws. These provisions proved crucial in resolving some very complex political problems in the North-East.

What distinguishes India from many other countries that face similar challenges is that the constitutional framework in India is much more flexible and accommodative. Therefore, regional aspirations are not encouraged to espouse separatism. Thus, politics in India has succeeded in accepting regionalism as part and parcel of democratic politics.

## Goa's Liberation

Although the British empire in India came to an end in 1947, Portugal refused to withdraw from the territories of Goa, Diu and Daman which were under its colonial rule since the sixteenth century. During their long rule, the Portuguese suppressed the people of Goa, denied them civil rights, and carried out forced religious conversions. After India’s Independence, the Indian government tried very patiently to persuade the Portuguese government to withdraw. There was also a strong popular movement within Goa for freedom. They were strengthened by socialist satyagrahis from Maharashtra. Finally, in December 1961, the Government of India sent the army which liberated these territories after barely two days of action. Goa, Diu and Daman became Union Territory.

Another complication arose soon. Led by the Maharashtrawadi Gomanatak Party (MGP) one section desired that Goa, as a Marathi speaking area should merge with Maharashtra. However, many Goans were keen to retain a separate Goan identity and culture, particularly the Konkani language. They were led by the United Goan Party (UGP). In January 1967, the Central Government held a special ‘opinion poll’ in Goa asking people to decide if they wanted to be part of Maharashtra or remain separate. A referendum-like procedure was used to ascertain people’s wishes on this issue. The majority voted in favour of remaining outside of Maharashtra. Thus, Goa continued as a Union Territory. Finally, in 1987, Goa became a State of the Indian Union.
