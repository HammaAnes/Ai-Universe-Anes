# Recent Developments in Indian Politics: Context of the 1990s

This chapter provides an overview of Indian politics during the last two decades. This period saw complex developments with diverse factors leading to unforeseen results. Understanding this new and controversial era, marked by deep conflicts, remains challenging. However, we can explore key questions about political change during this time:

*   How has the rise of coalition politics impacted Indian democracy?
*   What is the significance of Mandalisation, and how will it reshape political representation?
*   What is the legacy of the Ramjanambhoomi movement and the Ayodhya demolition on political mobilization?
*   How does the emergence of a new policy consensus affect political choices?

This chapter aims to equip readers with the information and analytical tools necessary to explore these questions further, rather than providing definitive answers. Addressing these politically sensitive topics is crucial for understanding contemporary Indian politics since Independence.

## Contents of the 1990s

Following Indira Gandhi's assassination, Rajiv Gandhi became Prime Minister and led the Congress to a major Lok Sabha victory in 1984. As the 1980s concluded, five key developments significantly impacted Indian politics:

1.  **Decline of Congress Dominance:** The Congress party's defeat in the 1989 elections, where its Lok Sabha seats fell from 415 in 1984 to 197, marked the end of the "Congress system." Although Congress regained power in the 1991 mid-term elections and remained influential after 1989, it lost its previous centrality.
2.  **Rise of the Mandal Issue:** In 1990, the National Front government's decision to implement the Mandal Commission's recommendation to reserve central government jobs for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) led to "anti-Mandal" protests. The "Mandal issue" became a major factor in shaping politics since 1989.

3.  **New Economic Reforms:** A significant shift in economic policy, known as the structural adjustment program or new economic reforms, began with Rajiv Gandhi but became prominent in 1991. This altered India's economic direction since Independence and, despite criticism, has been continued by subsequent governments.

4.  **Ayodhya Demolition:** The demolition of the disputed structure (Babri Masjid) in Ayodhya in December 1992 symbolized and triggered major political changes. This event intensified debates on Indian nationalism and secularism and is associated with the rise of the BJP and the politics of 'Hindutva.'

5.  **Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi:** The assassination of Rajiv Gandhi in May 1991, by a Sri Lankan Tamil linked to the LTTE, during an election campaign in Tamil Nadu, led to a leadership change in the Congress party. In the 1991 elections, Congress became the single largest party, and Narsimha Rao was chosen as Prime Minister.

## Era of Coalitions

The 1989 elections resulted in the Congress party's defeat without any other party securing a majority. While Congress was the largest party in the Lok Sabha, it decided to sit in the opposition. The National Front, an alliance of Janata Dal and regional parties, formed a coalition government with support from the BJP and the Left Front, although these parties did not join the government.

### Decline of Congress

The Congress party's defeat marked the end of its dominance over the Indian party system. The 1990s saw a challenge to the Congress's predominant position, but no single party emerged to replace it.

This marked the beginning of a multi-party system. While numerous parties have always contested elections, after 1989, several parties emerged, preventing any single party from securing a majority in Lok Sabha elections until 2014. This initiated an era of coalition governments at the Centre, where regional parties played a crucial role in forming ruling alliances.

### Alliance Politics

The 1990s also saw the emergence of powerful parties and movements representing Dalit and backward castes (OBCs). These parties played an important role in the United Front government that came to power in 1996, similar to the National Front of 1989, with support from Congress.

The BJP, after consolidating its position in the 1991 and 1996 elections, became the largest party in 1996 but could not secure a majority. It finally led a coalition government from May 1998 to June 1999 and was re-elected in October 1999. Atal Behari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister during both these NDA governments, with the government formed in 1999 completing its full term.

Since the 1989 elections, India has experienced a long phase of coalition politics. Eleven governments at the Centre have been either coalition governments or minority governments supported by other parties. In this new phase, governments required the participation or support of many regional parties, including the National Front in 1989, the United Front in 1996 and 1997, the NDA in 1997, the BJP-led coalition in 1998, the NDA in 1999, and the UPA in 2004 and 2009. However, this trend changed in 2014.

The era of coalition governments may be seen as a long-term trend resulting from changes that were taking place over the last few decades.

Previously, the Congress party itself was a 'coalition' of different interests and social groups, giving rise to the term 'Congress system.'

Since the late 1960s, various sections had been leaving the Congress fold and forming separate political parties. The rise of many regional parties after 1977 weakened the Congress party but did not enable any single party to replace it.

## Political Rise of Other Backward Classes

One long-term development was the rise of Other Backward Classes (OBCs) as a political force. Support for the Congress among many sections of the 'backward castes' had declined, creating space for non-Congress parties. These parties found political expression at the national level in the form of the Janata Party government in 1977.

### 'Mandal' Implemented

In the 1980s, the Janata Dal brought together a similar combination of political groups with strong support among the OBCs. The decision of the National Front government to implement the recommendations of the Mandal Commission further helped in shaping the politics of 'Other Backward Classes.' The national debate for and against reservation in jobs made people from the OBC communities more aware of this identity.

### The Mandal Commission

The Mandal Commission, officially known as the Second Backward Classes Commission, was set up in 1978 to investigate educational and social backwardness among various sections of Indian society and recommend ways of identifying 'backward classes.' The Commission gave its recommendations in 1980, advising that 'backward classes' should be understood to mean 'backward castes' and recommended reserving 27 per cent of seats in educational institutions and government jobs for these groups.

In August 1990, the National Front government decided to implement one of the recommendations of the Mandal Commission pertaining to reservations for OBCs in jobs. This decision sparked agitations and violent protests in many cities of north India. In November 1992, the Supreme Court gave a ruling upholding the decision of the government.

### Political Fallouts

The 1980s also saw the rise of political organization of the Dalits. In 1978 the Backward and Minority Communities Employees Federation (BAMCEF) was formed. Subsequently the Dalit Shoshit Samaj Sangharsh Samiti and later the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) emerged under the leadership of Kanshi Ram. In 1989 and the 1991 elections, it achieved a breakthrough in Uttar Pradesh. The BSP, under Kanshi Ram’s leadership was envisaged as an organisation based on pragmatic politics. Since then the BSP has emerged as a major political player in the State and has been in government on more than one occasion. In many parts of India, Dalit politics and OBC politics have developed independently and often in competition with each other.

## Communalism, Secularism, Democracy

The other long-term development during this period was the rise of politics based on religious identity, leading to a debate about secularism and democracy. After the fall of the Janata Party and its break-up, the supporters of erstwhile Jana Sangh formed the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP) in 1980. After 1986, the party began to emphasise the Hindu nationalist element in its ideology. The BJP pursued the politics of ‘Hindutva’ and adopted the strategy of mobilising the Hindus.

Hindutva literally means ‘Hinduness’ and was defined by its originator, V. D. Savarkar, as the basis of Indian (in his language also Hindu) nationhood.

Two developments around 1986 became central to the politics of BJP as a ‘Hindutva’ party. The first was the Shah Bano case in 1985. The second development was the order by the Faizabad district court in February 1986.

### Ayodhya Dispute

A dispute had been going on for many decades over the mosque known as Babri Masjid at Ayodhya. The Babri Masjid was a 16th century mosque in Ayodhya and was built by Mir Baqi – Mughal emperor Babur’s General. As soon as the locks of the Babri Masjid were opened, mobilisation began on both sides.

### Demolition and After

In December 1992, the organisations supporting the construction of the temple had organised a Karseva. The Supreme Court had ordered the State government to take care that the disputed site will not be endangered. However, thousands of people gathered from all over the country at Ayodhya on 6 December 1992 and demolished the mosque.

The events at Ayodhya led to a series of other developments. The State government, with the BJP as the ruling party, was dismissed by the Centre. Most political parties condemned the demolition and declared that this was against the principles of secularism. This led to a serious debate over secularism.

During this time, there has also been a debate about using religious sentiments for electoral purposes. Such violence against the minority community and violence between two communities is a threat to democracy.

### Gujarat Riots

In February-March 2002, large-scale violence took place in Gujarat. The immediate provocation for this violence was an incident that took place at a station called Godhra. Nearly 1100 persons, mostly Muslims, were killed in this violence. The National Human Rights Commission criticised the Gujarat government’s role in failing to control violence. Gujarat riots show that the governmental machinery also becomes susceptible to sectarian passions. This poses a threat to democratic politics.

## Emergence of a New Consensus

The period after 1989 is seen sometimes as the period of decline of Congress and rise of BJP. The political processes that are unfolding around us after the 1990s show the emergence of broadly four groups of parties – parties that are in coalition with the Congress; parties that are in alliance with the BJP; Left Front parties; and other parties who are not part of any of these three.

### Growing Consensus

However, on many crucial issues, a broad agreement has emerged among most parties. This consensus consists of four elements:

1.  **Agreement on new economic policies**
2.  **Acceptance of the political and social claims of the backward castes**
3.  **Acceptance of the role of State level parties in governance of the country**
4.  **Emphasis on pragmatic considerations rather than ideological positions and political alliances without ideological agreement**

All these are momentous changes and are going to shape politics in the near future. Issues like poverty, displacement, minimum wages, livelihood and social security are being put on the political agenda by peoples’ movements, reminding the state of its responsibility. Similarly, issues of justice and democracy are being voiced by the people in terms of class, caste, gender and regions.
