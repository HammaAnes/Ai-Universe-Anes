# Challenges to and Restoration of the Congress System

This chapter continues the narrative from Chapter Two, where the emergence of the Congress system was discussed. This dominance faced its initial challenges in the 1960s. Increased political competition made it difficult for the Congress to maintain its position. These challenges arose both from a stronger, more unified opposition and from internal divisions within the Congress itself. This chapter aims to:

*   Understand the political transition that occurred after Nehru's passing.
*   Describe how the Congress's dominance was challenged by opposition unity and an internal party split.
*   Explain how Indira Gandhi's new Congress addressed and overcame these challenges.
*   Analyze how new policies and ideologies contributed to the restoration of the Congress system.

## Challenge of Political Succession

Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru passed away in May 1964, following a period of illness lasting over a year. This event led to speculation about who would succeed him. More importantly, it raised serious questions about the future of Indian democracy without Nehru's leadership.

Many observers worried that India, like other newly independent nations, might struggle with a democratic transfer of power. Some feared this could lead to military involvement in politics. Concerns also existed regarding the new leadership's ability to manage ongoing crises. The 1960s were considered a "dangerous decade," with unresolved issues such as poverty, inequality, and communal/regional divisions potentially causing democratic failure or national disintegration.

## From Nehru to Shastri

The smooth succession following Nehru proved the critics wrong. K. Kamaraj, the Congress party president, consulted with party leaders and Members of Parliament. A consensus emerged in favor of Lal Bahadur Shastri, a non-controversial leader from Uttar Pradesh who had served as a Minister in Nehru's cabinet and was known for his simplicity and commitment to principles. Shastri was unanimously chosen as the leader of the Congress parliamentary party and became Prime Minister. He had previously resigned as Railway Minister, accepting moral responsibility for a railway accident.

Shastri served as Prime Minister from 1964 to 1966. During his brief tenure, India faced two major challenges: economic difficulties stemming from the war with China, coupled with failed monsoons, drought, and a severe food crisis; and the war with Pakistan in 1965. Shastri's slogan "Jai Jawan Jai Kisan" symbolized India's determination to overcome these obstacles.

Shastri's Prime Ministership ended abruptly on January 10, 1966, when he passed away in Tashkent (then in the USSR, now Uzbekistan), where he was to sign an agreement with Pakistan's President Muhammad Ayub Khan to end the war.

## From Shastri to Indira Gandhi

The Congress faced a second succession challenge within two years. This time, there was intense competition between Morarji Desai, former Chief Minister of Bombay state and a central minister, and Indira Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru's daughter, former Congress President, and Union Minister for Information in the Shastri cabinet. Senior party leaders backed Indira Gandhi, though not unanimously. A secret ballot among Congress MPs resolved the contest, with Indira Gandhi securing more than two-thirds of the votes. This peaceful transition of power was viewed as a sign of India's democratic maturity.

It took time for Indira Gandhi to become fully established as Prime Minister. Although politically experienced, she had only briefly served as a minister under Shastri. Senior Congress leaders might have supported her, expecting her inexperience to make her reliant on their guidance. Within a year, she led the party in a Lok Sabha election, amidst a deteriorating economic situation. To address these challenges, she sought to gain control over the party and demonstrate her leadership.

## Fourth General Elections, 1967

The year 1967 marked a turning point in Indian political and electoral history. The Congress party's dominance since 1952 faced significant changes in these elections.

### Context of the Elections

In the lead-up to the fourth general elections, India experienced significant changes. Two Prime Ministers had died in quick succession, and the new Prime Minister, seen as politically inexperienced, had been in office for less than a year. The period was marked by severe economic crisis due to successive monsoon failures, widespread drought, declining agricultural production, food shortages, depleted foreign exchange reserves, reduced industrial output and exports, and increased military spending, diverting resources from planned economic development. One of Indira Gandhi's initial decisions was to devalue the Indian rupee, perceived as being under pressure from the US.

This economic situation led to rising prices, prompting protests against essential commodity price increases, food scarcity, unemployment, and overall economic conditions. The government viewed these protests as law and order issues, further fueling public discontent. Communist and socialist parties launched movements advocating for greater equality. This period also saw some of the worst Hindu-Muslim riots since Independence.

### Non-Congressism

This unrest influenced party politics. Opposition parties spearheaded public protests, pressuring the government. Realizing that divided votes kept the Congress in power, parties with differing programs and ideologies formed anti-Congress fronts in some states and electoral alliances in others. They believed Indira Gandhi's inexperience and internal Congress divisions presented an opportunity to defeat the Congress. Socialist leader Ram Manohar Lohia termed this strategy "non-Congressism," arguing that Congress rule was undemocratic and against the interests of ordinary people, making the unity of non-Congress parties essential for restoring democracy.

### Electoral Verdict

Against this backdrop of public discontent and political polarization, the fourth general elections for the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies took place in February 1967. It was the first time the Congress faced the electorate without Nehru.

The results shocked the Congress at both national and state levels, described by observers as a "political earthquake." The Congress retained a majority in the Lok Sabha, but with its lowest seat tally and vote share since 1952. Many ministers in Indira Gandhi's cabinet were defeated, including prominent figures like Kamaraj, S.K. Patil, Atulya Ghosh, and K.B. Sahay.

The political change was even more apparent at the State level. The Congress lost its majority in seven states. Defections prevented it from forming a government in two others. These nine states spanned the country. In Madras State (now Tamil Nadu), the DMK, a regional party, secured a clear majority after leading student-led anti-Hindi agitations. This was the first time a non-Congress party had won a majority in any State. Coalition governments of various non-Congress parties formed in the other eight states.

### Coalitions

The 1967 elections highlighted the rise of coalitions. As no single party secured a majority, non-Congress parties formed joint legislative parties (Samyukt Vidhayak Dal) to support non-Congress governments. These were often ideologically diverse.

### Defection

Defections played a significant role in government formation and collapse after the 1967 election. Defection refers to an elected representative leaving the party under whose symbol they were elected and joining another party. Breakaway Congress legislators were instrumental in establishing non-Congress governments in Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh. Constant realignments and shifting loyalties led to the expression "Aya Ram, Gaya Ram."

## Split in the Congress

After the 1967 elections, the Congress retained power at the Centre with a reduced majority but lost power in many States. These results proved that the Congress could be defeated, but no substitute was available. Most non-Congress coalition governments in the States proved short-lived, leading to new combinations or President's rule.

### Indira vs. the 'Syndicate'

The real challenge to Indira Gandhi came from within her own party. She had to contend with the "Syndicate," a group of powerful and influential Congress leaders.

The Syndicate had played a role in making Indira Gandhi Prime Minister, expecting her to follow their advice. However, she gradually asserted her position, choosing her own advisors from outside the party and carefully sidelining the Syndicate.

Indira Gandhi faced two challenges: establishing independence from the Syndicate and regaining the ground lost by the Congress in the 1967 elections. She adopted a bold strategy, turning a power struggle into an ideological one. She launched initiatives to give government policy a Left orientation. The Congress Working Committee adopted a Ten Point Programme in May 1967, including social control of banks, nationalization of General Insurance, a ceiling on urban property and income, public distribution of food grains, land reforms, and provision of house sites to the rural poor. While the Syndicate formally approved this program, they had reservations.

### Presidential Election, 1969

The rivalry between the Syndicate and Indira Gandhi became public in 1969, following President Zakir Hussain's death. Despite Indira Gandhi's reservations, the Syndicate nominated N. Sanjeeva Reddy, her long-time opponent and Speaker of the Lok Sabha, as the official Congress candidate for the Presidential elections.

Indira Gandhi retaliated by encouraging Vice-President V.V. Giri to file his nomination as an independent candidate. She also announced major policy measures like nationalizing fourteen leading private banks and abolishing the "privy purse," or special privileges given to former princes. Morarji Desai, the Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister, disagreed with these measures, leading to his departure from the government.

The Congress had seen such differences before, but this time both sides sought a showdown during the Presidential elections. Congress President S. Nijalingappa issued a "whip" instructing Congress MPs and MLAs to vote for Sanjeeva Reddy. Indira Gandhi's supporters called for a special meeting of the AICC (All India Congress Committee), becoming known as "requisitionists," but this was refused. After silently supporting V.V. Giri, Indira Gandhi openly called for a "conscience vote," allowing Congress MPs and MLAs to vote as they wished. V.V. Giri, the independent candidate, won, and Sanjeeva Reddy, the official Congress candidate, lost.

The defeat of the official candidate formalized the split in the party. The Congress President expelled Indira Gandhi from the party, while she claimed that her group was the real Congress. By November 1969, the Congress group led by the Syndicate was referred to as Congress (Organisation), while the group led by Indira Gandhi became Congress (Requisitionists). These were also called Old Congress and New Congress. Indira Gandhi portrayed the split as an ideological divide between socialists and conservatives, between the pro-poor and the pro-rich.

## The 1971 Election and Restoration of Congress

The Congress split reduced Indira Gandhi's government to a minority. It continued in office with support from other parties, including the Communist Party of India and the DMK. The government consciously projected its socialist credentials and vigorously pursued land reform laws. To end her reliance on other parties, strengthen her party's position in Parliament, and seek a popular mandate for her programs, Indira Gandhi's government recommended the dissolution of the Lok Sabha in December 1970.

### The Contest

The electoral contest appeared to favor Congress (O). The new Congress was just one faction of a weakened party. The major non-communist, non-Congress opposition parties formed an electoral alliance known as the Grand Alliance, including the SSP, PSP, Bharatiya Jana Sangh, Swatantra Party, and Bharatiya Kranti Dal. The ruling party allied with the CPI.

However, the new Congress had an issue, an agenda, and a positive slogan that its opponents lacked. The Grand Alliance lacked a coherent political program. Indira Gandhi stated that the opposition's only program was "Indira Hatao" (Remove Indira). In contrast, she offered a positive program captured in the slogan "Garibi Hatao" (Remove Poverty). She focused on expanding the public sector, imposing ceilings on rural land holdings and urban property, removing income and opportunity disparities, and abolishing princely privileges. Through Garibi Hatao, Indira Gandhi aimed to build a support base among the disadvantaged, especially landless laborers, Dalits, Adivasis, minorities, women, and the unemployed youth. This slogan and the programs that followed were part of her strategy to build an independent nationwide political support base.

### The Outcome and After

The results of the 1971 Lok Sabha elections were as dramatic as the decision to hold them. The Congress (R)-CPI alliance won more seats and votes than the Congress had ever won in the first four general elections, securing 375 seats and 48.4% of the votes. Indira Gandhi's Congress (R) won 352 seats with about 44% of the popular vote on its own. Congress (O) won merely 16 seats.

With this victory, the Congress party led by Indira Gandhi established its claim to being the "real" Congress and restored its dominant position in Indian politics. The Grand Alliance was a failure, with a combined seat tally of less than 40.

Soon after the 1971 Lok Sabha elections, a major political and military crisis erupted in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). The 1971 elections were followed by the crisis in East Pakistan and the Indo-Pak war, leading to the establishment of Bangladesh. These events further increased Indira Gandhi's popularity. Her party swept the State Assembly elections held in 1972. She was seen as both the protector of the poor and the underprivileged and a strong nationalist leader.

With two successive election victories, the Congress was now in power in almost all the States. Within four years, Indira Gandhi had overcome the challenge to her leadership and to the dominant position of the Congress party.

## Restoration?

Did this mean the Congress system was truly restored? Indira Gandhi had not revived the old Congress party but had re-invented it. The party held a similar position in terms of popularity, but it was a different kind of party, relying entirely on the popularity of a single leader. The organizational structure was weaker. This new Congress lacked many factions and couldn't accommodate all opinions and interests. While it won elections, it depended more on specific social groups: the poor, women, Dalits, Adivasis, and minorities.

Thus, Indira Gandhi restored the Congress system by changing its very nature. Despite being more popular, the new Congress lacked the capacity to absorb all tensions and conflicts that the old Congress system was known for. The spaces for democratic expression of people's aspirations shrank. Popular unrest and mobilization around development and economic deprivation continued to grow, leading to a political crisis that threatened constitutional democracy, which is discussed in the next chapter.
