## India's External Relations

### Introduction

Up until now, this book has concentrated on internal developments and challenges within India. Now, we will shift our focus to the external challenges faced by the nation. Indian leaders responded to these challenges with an innovative approach, the policy of non-alignment. However, India also experienced conflicts with neighboring countries, leading to three wars in 1962, 1965, and 1971. These wars, and external relations in general, both shaped and were influenced by the political landscape within the country.

This chapter will explore the intricate relationship between external and internal politics by examining:

*   The international context that shaped India's external relations.
*   The guiding principles behind India's foreign policy.
*   The historical trajectory of India's relations with China and Pakistan.
*   The evolution of India's nuclear policy.

### International Context

India's emergence as a nation coincided with a particularly challenging international environment. The world was recovering from a devastating war and attempting to establish a new international body. Simultaneously, numerous new nations were arising from the decline of colonialism, and these nations were grappling with the dual challenges of ensuring welfare and establishing democracy. India's foreign policy, in the immediate aftermath of independence, reflected these global concerns. In addition to these global factors, India faced its own set of challenges. The British government left behind a legacy of international disputes, the Partition created unique pressures, and the critical task of poverty alleviation awaited attention. This was the backdrop against which India began its participation in global affairs as an independent nation-state.

India, having been born in the aftermath of a world war, resolved to conduct its foreign relations in a manner that respected the sovereignty of all nations and pursued security through peaceful means. This commitment is reflected in the Directive Principles of State Policy.

### Influences on Foreign Policy

Just as internal and external factors influence the actions of individuals or families, both the domestic and international environments shape a nation's foreign policy. Developing countries, often lacking the resources to effectively promote their interests in the international arena, tend to pursue more modest goals than advanced states. They prioritize peace and development within their immediate region. Furthermore, their economic and security dependence on more powerful nations can occasionally influence their foreign policy decisions. In the period immediately following World War II, many developing nations aligned their foreign policy preferences with those of powerful countries that provided them with aid or credit. This led to a division of the world into two distinct camps, one under the influence of the United States and its Western allies, and the other under the influence of the Soviet Union. This division and the Non-Aligned Movement are discussed in the book on Contemporary World Politics. The end of the Cold War fundamentally altered the international relations landscape. However, when India gained independence and began formulating its foreign policy, the Cold War was just beginning, and the world was increasingly divided into these two blocs. India faced the question of whether to align with either of these blocs in the global politics of the 1950s and 1960s, and whether it could successfully maintain a peaceful foreign policy while avoiding international conflicts.

### The Policy of Non-Alignment

The Indian national movement was not an isolated event. It was part of a global movement against colonialism and imperialism, and it inspired liberation movements in many Asian and African countries. Prior to India's independence, nationalist leaders from India and other colonies maintained contact, united in their common struggle against colonialism and imperialism. The creation of the Indian National Army (INA) by Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose during World War II clearly demonstrated the connections between India and overseas Indians during the freedom struggle.

A nation's foreign policy is a reflection of the interaction between domestic and external factors. Therefore, the ideals that inspired India's struggle for independence shaped its foreign policy. However, India's independence coincided with the beginning of the Cold War era. As discussed in the book, *Contemporary World Politics*, this period was marked by political, economic, and military confrontation between the two blocs led by the US and the USSR. The same period also witnessed the establishment of the UN, the development of nuclear weapons, the rise of Communist China, and the beginning of decolonization. Thus, India's leadership had to pursue its national interests within this international context.

### Nehru's Role

Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister, played a pivotal role in setting India's national agenda. He also served as his own foreign minister. As both Prime Minister and Foreign Minister from 1946 to 1964, Nehru exerted a significant influence on the formulation and implementation of India's foreign policy. The three primary objectives of Nehru's foreign policy were to preserve India's hard-won sovereignty, protect its territorial integrity, and promote rapid economic development. Nehru aimed to achieve these objectives through the strategy of non-alignment. While some parties and groups in India believed that the country should align more closely with the US-led bloc because of its pro-democracy stance (leaders like Dr. Ambedkar held this belief), and some political parties opposed to communism (such as the Bharatiya Jan Sangh and later the Swatantra Party) also favored a pro-US foreign policy, Nehru had considerable freedom in formulating foreign policy.

### Distance from Two Camps

Independent India's foreign policy actively pursued the vision of a peaceful world by advocating non-alignment, reducing Cold War tensions, and contributing personnel to UN peacekeeping operations. India chose not to join either of the two camps during the Cold War era. It sought to remain independent of the military alliances led by the US and the Soviet Union. During the Cold War, the US-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact were formed, as discussed in the book, *Contemporary World Politics*. India advocated non-alignment as the optimal foreign policy approach. This balancing act was challenging, and at times, the balance seemed imperfect. In 1956, when Britain attacked Egypt over the Suez Canal issue, India led the global protest against this neo-colonial action. However, in the same year, when the USSR invaded Hungary, India did not publicly condemn the invasion. Despite these instances, India generally maintained an independent stance on international issues and was able to secure aid and assistance from both blocs.

While India attempted to persuade other developing countries to adopt non-alignment, Pakistan joined US-led military alliances. The US was not pleased with India's independent initiatives and its policy of non-alignment, leading to considerable tension in Indo-US relations during the 1950s. The US also disapproved of India's growing partnership with the Soviet Union.

India's economic development strategy, as studied in the last chapter, emphasized import-substitution. This focus on developing a domestic resource base limited export-oriented growth and consequently, India's economic interaction with the outside world.

### Afro-Asian Unity

Despite these limitations, Nehru envisioned a significant role for India in world affairs, particularly in Asia, given its size, location, and potential power. His era was marked by the establishment of connections between India and other newly independent states in Asia and Africa. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Nehru was a strong advocate of Asian unity. Under his leadership, India convened the Asian Relations Conference in March 1947, just months before achieving its own independence. India actively supported the early liberation of Indonesia from Dutch colonial rule by organizing an international conference in 1949 to support Indonesia's freedom struggle. India was a staunch supporter of decolonization and firmly opposed racism, especially apartheid in South Africa. The Afro-Asian conference held in Bandung, Indonesia, in 1955, known as the Bandung Conference, marked the peak of India's engagement with newly independent Asian and African nations. The Bandung Conference eventually led to the creation of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). The first NAM summit took place in Belgrade in September 1961, and Nehru was a co-founder of the NAM (See Chapter 1 of *Contemporary World Politics*).

### Peace and Conflict with China

In contrast to its relationship with Pakistan, India initially enjoyed very friendly relations with China. After the Chinese revolution in 1949, India was among the first countries to recognize the communist government. Nehru felt a strong connection with this neighbor, which was emerging from Western dominance, and supported the new government in international forums. Some of his colleagues, like Vallabhbhai Patel, worried about possible Chinese aggression in the future. However, Nehru believed that an attack from China was "exceedingly unlikely." For a considerable period, the Chinese border was guarded by paramilitary forces rather than the army.

The joint declaration of Panchsheel, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, by Prime Minister Nehru and Premier Zhou Enlai on April 29, 1954, was a significant step towards strengthening the relationship between the two countries. Indian and Chinese leaders exchanged visits and were greeted by large and friendly crowds.

### The Tibetan Issue

The plateau of Tibet in central Asia is a major historical source of tension between India and China. Throughout history, China has claimed administrative control over Tibet, while at other times, Tibet has been independent. In 1950, China asserted control over Tibet, which was opposed by large segments of the Tibetan population. India attempted to persuade China to recognize Tibet's claims to independence. When the Panchsheel agreement was signed in 1954, India, through a clause on respecting each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty, conceded China's claim over Tibet. The Dalai Lama accompanied Premier Zhou Enlai during his official visit to India in 1956 and informed Nehru of the deteriorating situation in Tibet. China had assured India that Tibet would be granted greater autonomy than any other region within China. In 1958, an armed uprising against China's occupation occurred in Tibet, which was suppressed by Chinese forces. In 1959, the Dalai Lama, sensing that the situation had worsened, crossed the Indian border and sought asylum, which was granted. The Chinese government strongly protested this decision. Over the past half-century, many Tibetans have sought refuge in India and other countries worldwide. Large Tibetan refugee settlements exist in India, particularly in Delhi, and Dharmashala in Himachal Pradesh is perhaps the largest Tibetan refugee settlement in India, where the Dalai Lama has established his home. In the 1950s and 1960s, many political leaders and parties in India, including the Socialist Party and the Jan Sangh, supported the cause of Tibet's independence.

China has created the Tibet Autonomous Region, which is an integral part of China. Tibetans oppose China's claim to Tibet as part of Chinese territory and the policy of increasing the number of Chinese settlers in Tibet. They also dispute China's claim of granting autonomy to the region, believing that China seeks to undermine Tibet's traditional religion and culture.

### The Chinese Invasion, 1962

Two key developments strained the relationship between India and China. In 1950, China annexed Tibet, eliminating a historical buffer between the two countries. Initially, the Indian government did not openly oppose this. However, as more information emerged about the suppression of Tibetan culture, the Indian government became uneasy. In 1959, the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader, sought and received political asylum in India. China alleged that the Indian government was allowing anti-China activities to be conducted from within India.

Around the same time, a border dispute arose between India and China. India maintained that the boundary had been settled during colonial times, but China argued that any colonial decision was not binding. The main dispute centered on the western and eastern ends of the long border. China claimed two areas within Indian territory: the Aksai Chin area in the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir, and much of the state of Arunachal Pradesh, then known as NEFA (North Eastern Frontier Agency). Between 1957 and 1959, Chinese forces occupied the Aksai Chin area and constructed a strategic road there. Despite extensive correspondence and discussions between top leaders, these differences remained unresolved. Several minor border skirmishes took place between the armies of the two countries.

As the world focused on the Cuban Missile Crisis, China launched a swift and massive invasion in October 1962, targeting both disputed regions. The initial attack lasted a week, and Chinese forces captured key areas in Arunachal Pradesh. A second wave of attacks occurred the following month. While Indian forces managed to block Chinese advances on the western front in Ladakh, the Chinese advanced nearly to the entry point of the Assam plains in the east. China ultimately declared a unilateral ceasefire, and its troops withdrew to their pre-invasion positions.

The war with China damaged India's image both domestically and internationally. India had to seek military assistance from the US and Britain to overcome the crisis. The Soviet Union remained neutral during the conflict. The war caused a sense of national humiliation and strengthened a spirit of nationalism. Some of the top army commanders either resigned or were retired. Nehru's close associate and then Defence Minister, V. Krishna Menon, had to resign from the cabinet. Nehru's reputation suffered as he faced severe criticism for his naïve assessment of Chinese intentions and the lack of military preparedness. A no-confidence motion against his government was moved and debated in the Lok Sabha for the first time. Shortly after, the Congress party lost several key by-elections to the Lok Sabha, signaling a shift in the country's political mood.

### Sino-Indian Relations Since 1962

It took over a decade for India and China to normalize relations. Full diplomatic relations were restored in 1976. In 1979, Atal Behari Vajpayee, then External Affairs Minister, became the first high-level leader to visit China. Later, Rajiv Gandhi became the first Prime Minister after Nehru to visit China. Since then, the emphasis has been on trade relations between the two countries, as discussed in the book, *Contemporary World Politics*.

The Sino-Indian conflict also affected the opposition parties in India. The growing rift between China and the Soviet Union created irreconcilable differences within the Communist Party of India (CPI). The pro-USSR faction remained within the CPI and moved towards closer ties with the Congress party. The other faction, for a time closer to China, opposed any ties with the Congress party. The party split in 1964, and the leaders of the latter faction formed the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI-M). In the aftermath of the China war, many leaders of what became CPI (M) were arrested for being pro-China.

The war with China made the Indian leadership aware of the volatile situation in the Northeast region. In addition to being isolated and underdeveloped, this region presented India with challenges to national integration and political unity. The process of reorganizing the region began soon after the China war. Nagaland was granted statehood, and Manipur and Tripura, though Union Territories, were given the right to elect their own legislative assemblies.

### Wars and Peace with Pakistan

In the case of Pakistan, conflict began soon after Partition over the dispute regarding Kashmir. A more detailed explanation of this dispute is given in Chapter 8. A proxy war broke out between the Indian and Pakistani armies in Kashmir in 1947, but it did not escalate into a full-scale war. The issue was referred to the UN. Pakistan quickly became a crucial factor in India's relations with the US and, later, with China.

The Kashmir conflict did not prevent cooperation between the governments of India and Pakistan. Both governments worked together to return women abducted during Partition to their families. A long-standing dispute over the sharing of river waters was resolved through mediation by the World Bank. The Indus Waters Treaty between India and Pakistan was signed by Nehru and General Ayub Khan in 1960. Despite the fluctuations in Indo-Pak relations, this treaty has been successful.

A more serious armed conflict between the two countries began in 1965. Lal Bahadur Shastri had taken over as Prime Minister by then. In April 1965, Pakistan launched armed attacks in the Rann of Kutch area of Gujarat, followed by a larger offensive in Jammu and Kashmir in August-September. Pakistani rulers hoped for support from the local population there, but this did not materialize. To ease the pressure on the Kashmir front, Shastri ordered Indian troops to launch a counter-offensive on the Punjab border. In a fierce battle, the Indian army advanced close to Lahore.

Hostilities ended with UN intervention. Later, Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri of India and General Ayub Khan of Pakistan signed the Tashkent Agreement, brokered by the Soviet Union, in January 1966. While India inflicted considerable military losses on Pakistan, the 1965 war exacerbated India's already difficult economic situation.

### Bangladesh War, 1971

Pakistan faced its biggest internal crisis beginning in 1970. The country's first general election produced a split verdict: Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's party won in West Pakistan, while the Awami League led by Sheikh Mujib-ur Rahman swept through East Pakistan. The Bengali population of East Pakistan voted to protest against years of being treated as second-class citizens by the rulers based in West Pakistan. The Pakistani rulers were unwilling to accept the democratic verdict or the Awami League's demand for a federation.

Instead, in early 1971, the Pakistani army arrested Sheikh Mujib and unleashed a reign of terror on the people of East Pakistan. In response, the people began a struggle to liberate "Bangladesh" from Pakistan. Throughout 1971, India bore the burden of approximately 80 lakh refugees who fled East Pakistan and sought shelter in neighboring areas of India. India extended moral and material support to the freedom struggle in Bangladesh. Pakistan accused India of conspiring to break it up.

Support for Pakistan came from the US and China. The US-China rapprochement that began in the late 1960s resulted in a realignment of forces in Asia. Henry Kissinger, the adviser to US President Richard Nixon, made a secret visit to China via Pakistan in July 1971. To counter the US-Pakistan-China axis, India signed a 20-year Treaty of Peace and Friendship with the Soviet Union in August 1971. This treaty assured India of Soviet support in the event of an attack.

After months of diplomatic tension and military build-up, a full-scale war between India and Pakistan broke out in December 1971. Pakistani aircraft attacked Punjab and Rajasthan, while the army moved on the Jammu and Kashmir front. India retaliated with an attack involving the air force, navy, and army on both the Western and Eastern fronts. Welcomed and supported by the local population, the Indian army made rapid progress in East Pakistan. Within ten days, the Indian army had surrounded Dhaka from three sides, and the Pakistani army of approximately 90,000 had to surrender. With Bangladesh as a free country, India declared a unilateral ceasefire. Later, the signing of the Shimla Agreement between Indira Gandhi and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto on July 3, 1972, formalized the return of peace.

The decisive victory in the war led to national jubilation. Most people in India saw this as a moment of glory and a clear sign of India's growing military prowess. Indira Gandhi, the Prime Minister at the time, had already won the Lok Sabha elections in 1971. Her personal popularity soared further after the 1971 war. Following the war, assembly elections in most states resulted in large majorities for the Congress party.

India, with its limited resources, had initiated development planning. However, conflicts with neighbors derailed the five-year plans. Scarce resources were diverted to the defense sector, especially after 1962, as India embarked on a military modernization drive. The Department of Defence Production was established in November 1962, and the Department of Defence Supplies in November 1965. The Third Plan (1961-66) was affected, and it was followed by three Annual Plans. The Fourth Plan could only be initiated in 1969. India's defense expenditure increased significantly after the wars.

### India's Nuclear Policy

Another crucial development during this period was India's first nuclear explosion in May 1974. Nehru had always placed his faith in science and technology to rapidly build a modern India. A significant component of his industrialization plans was the nuclear program, initiated in the late 1940s under the guidance of Homi J. Bhabha. India wanted to generate atomic energy for peaceful purposes, and Nehru was against nuclear weapons. He advocated for comprehensive nuclear disarmament among the superpowers. However, the nuclear arsenal continued to grow. When Communist China conducted nuclear tests in October 1964, the five nuclear weapon powers (the US, USSR, UK, France, and China (then represented by Taiwan)), also the five Permanent Members of the UN Security Council, attempted to impose the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968 on the rest of the world. India always considered the NPT discriminatory and refused to sign it. India termed its first nuclear test a peaceful explosion, arguing that it remained committed to using nuclear power only for peaceful purposes.

The period when the nuclear test was conducted was politically challenging domestically. Following the Arab-Israel War of 1973, the world was affected by the Oil Shock due to the massive increase in oil prices by Arab nations, which led to economic turmoil and high inflation in India. As discussed in Chapter Six, many agitations were taking place in the country, including a nationwide railway strike.

Although there are minor differences among political parties regarding the conduct of external relations, Indian politics is generally characterized by a broad agreement among parties on national integration, protection of international boundaries, and matters of national interest. As a result, in the decade of 1962-1971, when India faced three wars, and even later when different parties came to power, foreign policy played only a limited role in party politics.

### Shifting Alliances in World Politics

As you will read in Chapter Six and Chapter Nine, many non-Congress governments came to power in the period starting 1977. This was also the time when world politics was changing dramatically. What did it mean for India’s external relations?

The Janata Party government that came to power in 1977 announced that it would follow genuine non-alignment. This implied that the pro-Soviet tilt in the foreign policy will be corrected. Since then, all governments (Congress or non-Congress) have taken initiatives for restoring better relations with China and entering into close ties with US. In Indian politics and in popular mind, India’s foreign policy is always very closely linked to two questions. One is India’s stand vis-à-vis Pakistan and the other is Indo-US relations. In the post-1990 period the ruling parties have often been criticised for their pro-US foreign policy.

Foreign policy is always dictated by ideas of national interest. In the period after 1990, Russia, though it continues to be an important friend of India, has lost its global pre-eminence. Therefore, India’s foreign policy has shifted to a more pro-US strategy. Besides, the contemporary international situation is more influenced by economic interests than by military interests. This has also made an impact on India’s foreign policy choices. At the same time, Indo-Pakistan relations have witnessed many new developments during this period. While Kashmir continues to be the main issue between the two countries, there have been many efforts to restore normal relations. This means that cultural exchanges, movement of citizens and economic cooperation would be encouraged by both countries. Do you know that a train and a bus service operate between these two countries? This has been a major achievement of the recent times. But that could not avoid the near-war situation from emerging in 1999. Even after this setback to the peace process, efforts at negotiating durable peace have been going on.

### India's Nuclear Programme

India has opposed the international treaties aimed at non-proliferation since they were selectively applicable to the non-nuclear powers and legitimised the monopoly of the five nuclear weapons powers. Thus, India opposed the indefinite extension of the NPT in 1995 and also refused to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).

India conducted a series of nuclear tests in May 1998, demonstrating its capacity to use nuclear energy for military purposes. Pakistan soon followed, thereby increasing the vulnerability of the region to a nuclear exchange. The international community was extremely critical of the nuclear tests in the subcontinent and sanctions were imposed on both India and Pakistan, which were subsequently waived. India’s nuclear doctrine of credible minimum nuclear deterrence professes “no first use” and reiterates India’s commitment to global, verifiable and non-discriminatory nuclear disarmament leading to a nuclear weapons free world.
