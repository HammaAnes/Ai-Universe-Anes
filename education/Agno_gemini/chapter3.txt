# Politics of Planned Development

In the preceding chapters, we examined independent India's leadership and its response to the challenges of building a nation and establishing democracy. Now, we will shift our focus to a third challenge: achieving economic development to ensure the well-being of all citizens. Similar to the first two challenges, our leaders opted for a unique and difficult approach, although their success in this area was comparatively limited due to the persistent and complex nature of the challenge.

This chapter explores the political decisions surrounding key questions of economic development:

*   What were the central choices and debates concerning development?
*   What strategy did Indian leaders adopt in the first two decades after independence, and why?
*   What were the primary achievements and limitations of this strategy?
*   Why was this development strategy abandoned in later years?

**Political Contestation**

As global demand for steel rises, Orissa, possessing significant untapped iron ore reserves, attracts substantial investment interest. The state government aims to capitalize on this unprecedented demand and has signed Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with both international and domestic steel manufacturers, expecting capital investment and job creation. However, these iron ore resources are located in underdeveloped, predominantly tribal districts. The tribal population fears displacement and loss of livelihood due to industrial development, while environmentalists worry about pollution from mining and industry. The central government fears discouraging investment if the industry is not permitted.

What are the conflicting interests in this case? Are there any common ground for agreement? Can the issue be resolved to satisfy all parties involved? What kind of development does Orissa truly need? Whose needs should define "Orissa's need"?

These questions require political decisions involving the interests of different social groups and present versus future generations, rather than purely expert opinions. In a democracy, such crucial decisions should be made or approved by the people. While expert advice from mining specialists, environmentalists, and economists is valuable, the final decision should be a political one, made by people's representatives responsive to public sentiment.

Post-Independence, India faced numerous major decisions interconnected by a shared vision or model for economic development. A consensus existed that development should encompass both economic growth and socio-economic justice, with the government playing a key role. However, disagreement arose regarding the extent and nature of the government's role in ensuring growth with justice. Should a centralized institution plan for the entire country? Should the government operate key industries and businesses? How much emphasis should be placed on justice if it conflicts with economic growth?

These questions sparked ongoing debates with political consequences, requiring political judgment, consultation among parties, and public approval. Thus, the development process is an integral part of Indian political history.

**Ideas of Development**

Contestation often arises from differing ideas of development. As illustrated by the Orissa example, development means different things to different people. It holds varying significance for industrialists planning steel plants, urban consumers of steel, and indigenous people living in the affected regions. Consequently, discussions on development are prone to generate contradictions, conflicts, and debates.

In the first decade after independence, there were extensive debates around these issues. The 'West' was often used as a benchmark for development, with 'modernity' equated to Western industrialization. Modernization involved breaking down traditional social structures and embracing capitalism and liberalism, and was associated with growth, material progress, and scientific rationality. This view categorized countries as developed, developing, or underdeveloped.

On the eve of Independence, India had two models of modern development to consider: the liberal-capitalist model, as seen in much of Europe and the US, and the socialist model, as practiced in the USSR. Many in India were deeply impressed by the Soviet model, including leaders from the Communist Party of India, the Socialist Party, and figures like Nehru within the Congress. There was limited support for American-style capitalist development.

This reflected a consensus that had developed during the national movement. Nationalist leaders agreed that the economic responsibilities of a free India's government would differ from the colonial government's commercial functions. Alleviating poverty and achieving socio-economic redistribution was primarily the government's responsibility. While some favored industrialization, others prioritized agricultural development and rural poverty reduction.

**Planning**

Despite differences, there was agreement that development should not be left to private actors, and that government should create a plan for development. The idea of planning as a process of rebuilding the economy was popular in the 1940s and 1950s, influenced by the Great Depression, post-war reconstruction, and Soviet economic growth.

The Planning Commission was not a new invention. Surprisingly, big industrialists supported planned economy. In 1944, they jointly drafted the Bombay Plan, which wanted the state to take major initiatives in economic investments. Planning for development was the obvious choice after independence. Soon after India became independent, the Planning Commission came into being, chaired by the Prime Minister, becoming the central machinery for deciding what path and strategy India would adopt for its development.

**The Early Initiatives**

Following the Soviet model, the Planning Commission adopted five-year plans (FYPs). The Government of India prepares a document outlining its income and expenditure plan for the next five years. Government budgets are divided into 'non-plan' (routine, yearly expenses) and 'plan' (five-year, priority-based spending). A five-year plan enables the government to focus on the larger picture and make long-term interventions in the economy.

The draft of the First Five Year Plan and then the actual Plan Document, released in December 1951, generated excitement, with widespread discussion and debate. The excitement with planning reached its peak with the launching of the Second Five Year Plan in 1956 and continued somewhat till the Third Five Year Plan in 1961. By the time the Fourth Plan was due to start in 1966, the novelty of planning had declined, and India was facing an economic crisis, leading to a "plan holiday". Despite criticisms, the foundation of India's economic development was firmly in place.

**The First Five Year Plan**

The First Five Year Plan (1951-1956) aimed to break the cycle of poverty. Economist K.N. Raj argued for a cautious approach in the first two decades to protect democracy. The plan focused on the agrarian sector, including investments in dams and irrigation, and identified land distribution as the main obstacle to agricultural growth, prioritizing land reforms.

The planners also aimed to raise the level of national income, which could be possible only if the people saved more money than they spent. Savings did rise until the end of the Third Five Year Plan, but not as much as was expected at the beginning of the First Plan. From the early 1960s till the early 1970s, the proportion of savings in the country actually dropped consistently.

**Rapid Industrialisation**

The Second FYP emphasized heavy industries and was drafted by a team led by P. C. Mahalanobis. While the first plan was patient, the second aimed for quick structural transformation. The Congress party declared a 'socialist pattern of society' as its goal, reflected in the Second Plan. The government imposed tariffs on imports to protect domestic industries, fostering growth in both public and private sectors. The push for industrialization marked a turning point in India's development.

However, India's technological backwardness required spending foreign exchange to acquire technology. Industry's dominance in investment raised concerns about food shortages. Balancing industry and agriculture proved difficult. Critics claimed the plan had an "urban bias," prioritizing industry over agriculture. Others wanted to focus on agriculture-related industries rather than heavy ones.

**Key Controversies**

The development strategy raised several important questions. Let's examine two enduring disputes.

*   **Agriculture versus Industry:** Which sector should receive more public resources? Some felt the Second Plan lacked an agrarian strategy, harming agriculture and rural India. Gandhian economists like J. C. Kumarappa advocated for rural industrialization. Chaudhary Charan Singh argued for prioritizing agriculture, claiming planning enriched urban areas at the expense of farmers. Others argued industrial growth was essential to escaping poverty and that Indian planning did include an agrarian strategy, citing land reform laws, community development programs, and irrigation projects. Policy implementation failures were blamed on the political power of landowning classes.

*   **Public versus Private Sector:** India did not fully embrace capitalism (private sector-led) or socialism (state-controlled production). A 'mixed economy' emerged, with private involvement in agriculture, trade, and industry alongside state control of key industries, infrastructure provision, trade regulation, and agricultural interventions. Critics on the left argued that the state's intervention created a new ‘middle class’ that enjoyed the privileges of high salaries without much accountability. Poverty did not decline substantially during this period; even when the proportion of the poor reduced, their numbers kept going up. Critics on the right, argued that the planners refused to provide the private sector with enough space and the stimulus to grow. The state's policy to restrict import of goods that could be produced in the domestic market with little or no competition left the private sector with no incentive to improve their products and make them cheaper.

**Major Outcome**

Of the three objectives identified for independent India, economic development and well-being for all proved the most challenging. Land reforms were ineffective, political power remained with landowning classes, and big industrialists prospered while poverty persisted. The early initiatives realized the goals of economic development of the country and well-being of all its citizens at best. The inability to take significant steps in this direction in the very first stage was to become a political problem. Those who benefited from unequal development soon became politically powerful and made it even more difficult to move in the desired direction.

**Foundations**

The initial phase of planned development established the foundations for India's future economic growth. Mega-dams like Bhakhra-Nangal and Hirakud were constructed for irrigation and power, and heavy industries in the public sector, such as steel plants and oil refineries, were established. Transport and communication infrastructure improved. Despite recent criticism, subsequent economic growth, including by the private sector, relied on these foundations.

**Land Reforms**

The agrarian sector saw attempts at land reform, most notably the abolition of the zamindari system. This released land from unproductive control and reduced the landlords' political influence. Land consolidation efforts were also successful. However, other land reform components, such as land ceilings and tenant security, were less successful due to evasion and lack of implementation.

Translating these policies into action required mobilizing the rural poor, which was difficult due to the landowners' power. Consequently, many proposals were either not enacted or remained on paper. This demonstrates that economic policy is intertwined with the political landscape and that dominant social groups can effectively control policy-making and implementation.

**Food Crisis**

The agricultural situation worsened in the 1960s. Food grain production barely kept pace with population growth, and severe droughts from 1965 to 1967, coupled with wars and foreign exchange crisis, resulted in severe food shortages and famine-like conditions.

Bihar faced the most acute food crisis. Food shortages led to malnutrition, with calorie intake dropping significantly. The death rate in Bihar in 1967 was 34% higher than the number of deaths that occurred in the following year. Food prices hit a high, even when compared with other north Indian states. Government "zoning" policies restricted food trade across states, exacerbating the situation. The poorest sections of society suffered the most.

The food crisis forced the government to import wheat and accept foreign aid, primarily from the US. Attaining self-sufficiency in food became the top priority, and the planning process suffered a setback.

**The Green Revolution**

Faced with vulnerability and reliance on food aid, particularly from the US, the government adopted a new agricultural strategy. Instead of supporting lagging areas, resources were directed towards areas with irrigation and well-off farmers, with the intention of rapidly increasing production. High-yielding seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and better irrigation were offered at subsidized prices, along with guaranteed crop purchases. This marked the beginning of the "Green Revolution."

Rich peasants and large landholders were the primary beneficiaries. The Green Revolution led to moderate agricultural growth (mainly in wheat production) and improved food availability, but it also increased class and regional disparities. Regions like Punjab, Haryana, and western Uttar Pradesh prospered, while others lagged. The stark contrast between the poor and landlords fostered left-wing organization, and the rise of politically influential middle peasant sections also emerged.

**Later Developments**

From the late 1960s, India's development story took a turn. After Nehru's death, the Congress system faced difficulties, and Indira Gandhi emerged as a popular leader. She strengthened the state's role in controlling and directing the economy, introducing new restrictions on private industry, nationalizing fourteen private banks, and launching pro-poor programs. These changes were accompanied by a shift towards socialist policies, sparking debates among political parties and experts.

The consensus on state-led economic development eventually waned. Planning continued, but its influence diminished. From 1950 to 1980, the Indian economy grew at a sluggish rate of 3 to 3.5% per annum. Inefficiency and corruption in some public sector enterprises led to a loss of public faith, prompting policymakers to reduce the state's role from the 1980s onwards. We will look at that part of the story towards the end of this book.

    “In the early years of Independence, two contradictory tendencies were already well advanced inside the Congress party.

On the other hand, the national Congress government pursued liberal economic policies and incentives to private investment that was justified in terms of the sole criterion of achieving maximum increase in production. “ — FRANCINE FRANKEL
