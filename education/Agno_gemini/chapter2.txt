# Era of One-Party Dominance: The Challenge of Building Democracy

Following the challenge of nation-building discussed previously, independent India faced the task of establishing democratic politics. Electoral contests among political parties commenced immediately after Independence. This chapter examines the first decade of electoral politics to understand:

*   The establishment of a system of free and fair elections.
*   The dominance of the Congress party in the immediate post-Independence years.
*   The emergence of opposition parties and their policies.

## The Challenge of Building Democracy

India was born into difficult circumstances. The serious challenge of nation-building confronted the country right at the outset. Recognizing similar difficulties, leaders in many other newly independent countries decided against democracy, prioritizing national unity and fearing that democracy would introduce division and conflict. Consequently, many former colonies experienced non-democratic rule, ranging from nominal democracy with control by a single leader to one-party rule or direct military control. These non-democratic regimes often promised a swift return to democracy, but these promises were rarely fulfilled.

The situation in India was comparable, but India's leaders chose the more challenging democratic path. This decision was consistent with the deep commitment to democracy inherent in the freedom struggle. Indian leaders recognized the crucial role of politics in a democracy. They viewed politics not as a problem, but as a means of solving problems. Every society must decide how it will govern itself, and there are always multiple policy choices. Because there are diverse groups with different and conflicting aspirations, democratic politics becomes an answer to resolving these differences. Competition and power are visible elements of politics, but political activity's purpose is and should be deciding and pursuing public interest.

## Establishing Elections: A Mammoth Task

The Constitution, adopted on **November 26, 1949**, signed on **January 24, 1950,** and effective from **January 26, 1950**, established the framework. Ruled by an interim government at that time, the country needed to install its first democratically elected government. The Election Commission of India was established in **January 1950**, with Sukumar Sen as the first Chief Election Commissioner, and the first general elections were anticipated in **1950** itself.

However, the Election Commission realized the magnitude of holding free and fair elections in a country the size of India. Key tasks included:

*   **Delimitation:** Drawing the boundaries of electoral constituencies.
*   **Electoral Rolls:** Preparing a list of all eligible voters.

These tasks proved time-consuming. The initial draft of the electoral rolls revealed that nearly 4 million women were listed as "wife of…" or "daughter of…", without their own names. The Election Commission rejected these entries and ordered revisions or deletions. The first general election required a massive undertaking with 17 crore eligible voters electing approximately 3,200 MLAs and 489 Members of Lok Sabha. With only 15% of eligible voters being literate, the Election Commission devised special voting methods and trained over 3 lakh officers and polling staff.

The first general election was also the first major test of democracy in a poor and largely illiterate country. Democracy had previously existed mostly in prosperous, literate countries in Europe and North America, and many European countries had not yet granted voting rights to all women. Therefore, India's experiment with universal adult franchise was bold.

The elections were postponed twice, finally taking place from **October 1951 to February 1952**, but are known as the 1952 election due to the majority of the country voting in **January 1952.** Campaigning, polling, and counting took six months. The elections were competitive, with an average of more than four candidates per seat. Voter participation was encouraging, with over half of the eligible voters participating. The declared results were accepted as fair, even by the losing parties.

India's experiment disproved critics. The *Times of India* stated the polls "confounded all those skeptics who thought the introduction of adult franchise too risky an experiment in this country." The *Hindustan Times* claimed that "there is universal agreement that the Indian people have conducted themselves admirably in the largest experiment in democratic elections in the history of the world." International observers were equally impressed. India's **1952** general election became a landmark, proving that democratic elections could be held even in conditions of poverty and illiteracy.

## Congress Dominance in the First Three General Elections

The results of the first general election were not surprising: the Indian National Congress was expected to win. The Congress party had inherited the legacy of the national movement. It was the only party with a nationwide organization, and it had Jawaharlal Nehru, the most popular leader in Indian politics.

The Congress party won 364 of the 489 seats in the first Lok Sabha. The Communist Party of India (CPI), the next largest party, won only 16 seats. The Congress won a majority of seats in all state elections held alongside the Lok Sabha elections, except in Travancore-Cochin (now part of Kerala), Madras, and Orissa. The Congress formed the government even in these states. Jawaharlal Nehru became Prime Minister after the first general election.

The Congress maintained its dominance in the second and third general elections, held in **1957** and **1962**, winning three-fourths of the Lok Sabha seats. No opposition party could win even one-tenth of the number of seats won by the Congress. Despite this, the Congress did not always achieve a majority in all state assembly elections. In Kerala in **1957**, a coalition led by the CPI formed the government.

The extent of the Congress victory was boosted by the electoral system. Although the Congress won three out of every four seats, it did not get even half of the votes. For example, in **1952**, the Congress obtained 45% of the total votes but managed to win 74% of the seats. The Socialist Party, the second largest party in terms of votes, secured more than 10% of the votes, but it could not even win 3% of the seats. The "first-past-the-post" system favored the Congress because the non-Congress votes were divided among several parties and candidates.

## Communist Victory in Kerala

In **1957**, the Congress party experienced defeat in Kerala. The Communist Party won the largest number of seats in the assembly elections in March **1957**. They won 60 of the 126 seats and had the support of five independents. The governor invited E. M. S. Namboodiripad, the leader of the Communist legislature party, to form the government. This was the first time a Communist government had come to power through democratic elections.

The Congress party then began a 'liberation struggle' against the elected government. The CPI had come to power on the promise of carrying out radical and progressive policies. The Communists claimed that the agitation was led by vested interests and religious organizations.

In **1959**, the Congress government at the Centre dismissed the Communist government in Kerala under Article 356 of the Constitution. This decision proved controversial and was cited as the first instance of the misuse of constitutional emergency powers.

## Socialist Party

The origins of the Socialist Party can be traced to the Indian National Congress in the pre-independence era. The Congress Socialist Party (CSP) was formed within the Congress in **1934** by young leaders who wanted a more radical and egalitarian Congress. In **1948**, the Congress prevented its members from having a dual party membership. This forced the Socialists to form a separate Socialist Party in **1948**. The Party’s electoral performance was disappointing.

The socialists believed in democratic socialism. They criticized the Congress for favoring capitalists and landlords. In **1955**, the Congress declared its goal to be the socialist pattern of society, making it difficult for the socialists to present themselves as an alternative to the Congress.

The Socialist Party went through splits and reunions leading to the formation of many socialist parties, including the Kisan Mazdoor Praja Party, the Praja Socialist Party and Samyukta Socialist Party. Many parties in contemporary India trace their origins to the Socialist Party.

## Nature of Congress Dominance

India is not the only country to have experienced the dominance of one party. However, unlike countries like China, Cuba, Syria, Myanmar, Belarus, Egypt, Eritrea, Mexico, South Korea and Taiwan, the dominance of the Congress party in India happened under democratic conditions. Many parties contested elections in free and fair conditions, and the Congress managed to win election after election. This was similar to the dominance the African National Congress has enjoyed in South Africa after the end of apartheid.

The roots of the Congress party's success lay in the legacy of the freedom struggle, and many of the leaders who had been at the forefront of that struggle were now contesting elections as Congress candidates. By the time of Independence, the party had not only spread across the length and breadth of the country but also had an organizational network down to the local level. As the Congress was till recently a national movement, its nature was all-inclusive. All these factors contributed to the dominance of the Congress party.

## Congress as Social and Ideological Coalition

The Congress party began as a party dominated by the English speaking, upper caste, upper middle-class and urban elite. But with every civil disobedience movement it launched, its social base widened. Peasants and industrialists, urban dwellers and villagers, workers and owners, middle, lower and upper classes and castes, all found space in the Congress. By the time of Independence, the Congress was transformed into a rainbow-like social coalition representing India’s diversity.

Many of these groups merged their identity within the Congress. Very often they did not and continued to exist within the Congress as groups and individuals holding different beliefs. In this sense the Congress was an ideological coalition. It accommodated the revolutionary and pacifist, conservative and radical, extremist and moderate and the right, left and all shades of the centre. In pre-Independence days, many organizations and parties with their own constitution and organizational structure were allowed to exist within the Congress. Some of these, like the Congress Socialist Party, later separated from the Congress and became opposition parties.

## Tolerance and Management of Factions

This coalition-like character of the Congress gave it strength. It was able to avoid any extreme position and strike a balance on almost all issues. This strategy put the opposition in a difficult position. The Congress also had a greater tolerance of internal differences. Since there was room within the party for various factions to fight with each other, it meant that leaders representing different interests and ideologies remained within the Congress rather than go out and form a new party. Most of the state units of the Congress were made up of numerous factions.

## Emergence of Opposition Parties

India had a larger number of diverse and vibrant opposition parties than many other multi-party democracies. Some of these had come into being even before the first general election of **1952**, and some played an important part in the politics of the country in the ’sixties and ’seventies. The roots of almost all the non-Congress parties of today can be traced to one or the other of the opposition parties of the 1950s.

These parties offered a sustained criticism of the policies and practices of the Congress party. By keeping democratic political alternative alive, these parties prevented the resentment with the system from turning anti-democratic. These parties also groomed leaders who were to play a crucial role in the shaping of our country. In the early years there was a lot of mutual respect between the leaders of the Congress and those of the opposition.

## Bharatiya Jana Sangh

The Bharatiya Jana Sangh was formed in **1951** with Shyama Prasad Mukherjee as its founder-President. Its lineage however can be traced back to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Hindu Mahasabha before Independence.

The Jana Sangh emphasized the idea of one country, one culture and one nation. The party called for a reunion of India and Pakistan in Akhand Bharat. The party was in forefront of the agitation to replace English with Hindi as the official language of India and was also opposed to the granting of concessions to religious and cultural minorities. The party was a consistent advocate of India developing nuclear weapons especially after China carried out its atomic tests in **1964**.

In the 1950s Jana Sangh was able to secure only 3 Lok Sabha seats in **1952** elections and 4 seats in **1957** general elections to Lok Sabha. In the early years its support came mainly from the urban areas in the Hindi speaking states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh.

## The Communist Party of India

In the early 1920s communist groups emerged in different parts of India taking inspiration from the Bolshevik revolution in Russia and advocating socialism. From 1935, the Communists worked mainly from within the fold of the Indian National Congress.

A parting of ways took place in **December 1941**, when the Communists decided to support the British in their war against Nazi Germany. Unlike other non-Congress parties the CPI had a well-oiled party machinery and dedicated cadre at the time of Independence.

The party thought that the transfer of power in **1947** was not true independence and encouraged violent uprisings in Telangana. In **1951** the Communist Party abandoned the path of violent revolution and decided to participate in the approaching general elections. In the first general election, CPI won 16 seats. The Party went through a major split in **1964** following the ideological rift between Soviet Union and China.

## Swatantra Party

Swatantra Party was formed in **August 1959** after the Nagpur resolution of the Congress which called for land ceilings, take-over of food grain trade by the state and adoption of cooperative farming.

The Swatantra Party wanted the government to be less involved in controlling the economy. It was critical of the development strategy of state intervention in the economy, centralised planning, nationalisation and the public sector. It instead favoured expansion of a free private sector. The Swatantra Party was against land ceilings in agriculture, and opposed cooperative farming and state trading. It was also opposed to the progressive tax regime and demanded dismantling of the licensing regime.
