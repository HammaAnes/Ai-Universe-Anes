# The Crisis of Democratic Order

Following the Congress party's recovery after 1971, events between 1973 and 1975 revealed significant shifts in India's democratic landscape and the Constitution's intended institutional balance. These shifts culminated in the declaration of a state of "emergency" in June 1975, which, unlike emergencies typically associated with war or natural disasters, was triggered by perceived internal threats. The Emergency ended abruptly, leading to the Congress party's defeat in the 1977 Lok Sabha elections.

This chapter examines this critical period in India's democratic history, addressing enduring controversial questions:

*   What were the reasons behind the Emergency's imposition, and was it justified?
*   How did the Emergency manifest itself in practice?
*   What impact did the Emergency have on party politics?
*   What lessons did the Emergency impart to Indian democracy?

On June 27, 1975, the 'Nai Dunia' newspaper editorial page was intentionally left blank, the space "censored" under emergency powers. Other newspapers also left blank spaces, sometimes as a form of protest. Later, this practice was also banned.

## Background to Emergency

Political changes since 1967 saw Indira Gandhi rise as a dominant leader. Party competition became intense and polarized. Tensions also grew between the government and the judiciary. The Supreme Court deemed many government initiatives unconstitutional. The Congress party argued the Court's position undermined democracy and parliamentary supremacy, alleging the Court was conservative and hindered pro-poor welfare programs. Opposition parties felt politics had become too personalized and governmental authority was transforming into personal authority. The Congress split intensified divisions between Indira Gandhi and her opponents.

## Economic Context

Despite the Congress party's 1971 slogan of "garibi hatao" (remove poverty), socio-economic conditions did not significantly improve post-1971-72. The Bangladesh crisis strained India's economy, with approximately eight million people crossing into India. The subsequent war with Pakistan led to the U.S. government halting aid to India. A sharp rise in international oil prices caused widespread inflation, with prices increasing by 23% in 1973 and 30% in 1974, causing hardship.

Industrial growth remained low, and unemployment was high, especially in rural areas. Government froze employee salaries to reduce expenditure, causing dissatisfaction. The 1972-1973 monsoons failed, causing an 8% drop in agricultural productivity and a general atmosphere of discontent. Non-Congress opposition parties effectively organized popular protests. Student unrest, present since the late 1960s, became more pronounced, and Marxist groups advocating armed struggle against the capitalist order and the established political system increased activities. These groups, known as Marxist-Leninist (now Maoist) groups or Naxalites, were particularly strong in West Bengal, where the State government implemented strict measures to suppress them.

## Gujarat and Bihar Movements

Student protests in Gujarat and Bihar, both Congress-ruled states, significantly impacted state and national politics. In January 1974, Gujarat students protested rising prices of essential commodities and corruption. Major opposition parties joined the protest, leading to President's rule. Morarji Desai, a prominent Congress (O) leader and Indira Gandhi's main rival, threatened an indefinite fast unless fresh state elections were held. Under pressure from students and opposition parties, assembly elections were held in Gujarat in June 1975, where the Congress was defeated.

In March 1974, students in Bihar protested rising prices, food scarcity, unemployment, and corruption. They invited Jayaprakash Narayan (JP), who had left active politics for social work, to lead the movement. He accepted on the condition of non-violence and national scope. The students’ movement gained a political character and national appeal. Jayaprakash Narayan demanded the dismissal of the Congress government in Bihar and called for a "total revolution" to establish true democracy. Protests were organized against the Bihar government, which refused to resign.

## The Naxalite Movement

In 1967, a peasant uprising occurred in the Naxalbari police station area of Darjeeling hills district in West Bengal under the leadership of the local cadres of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Originating from the Naxalbari police station, the peasant movement spread to several states of India and became widely known as the Naxalite movement. In 1969, they broke off from the CPI (M) and formed a new party, the Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) (CPI-ML), led by Charu Majumdar, which argued that democracy in India was a sham and adopted a strategy of protracted guerrilla warfare to lead to a revolution.

The Naxalite movement forcibly seized land from rich landowners and distributed it to the poor and landless. Its supporters advocated violent means to achieve their political goals. Despite preventive detention and other strong measures taken by the Congress party-run West Bengal government, the Naxalite movement persisted and spread to other parts of the country. The Naxalite movement has since splintered into various parties and organizations, with some, such as the CPI – ML (Liberation), participating in open, democratic politics.

Currently, about 75 districts in nine States are affected by Naxalite violence, mostly backward areas inhabited by Adivasis. In these areas, sharecroppers, under-tenants, and small cultivators are denied their basic rights regarding security of tenure, share in produce, and fair wages. Forced labor, expropriation of resources by outsiders, and exploitation by moneylenders are also common, leading to the growth of the Naxalite movement.

Governments have taken stern measures in dealing with the Naxalite movement. Human rights activists have criticized the government for violating constitutional norms in dealing with the Naxalites. Many thousands of people have lost their lives in the violence by the Naxalites and the anti-Naxalite violence by the government.

## Railway Strike of 1974

The 1974 Railway strike was a nationwide strike by railway employees, called by the National Coordination Committee for Railwaymen’s Struggle led by George Fernandes, for pressing demands related to bonus and service conditions. The government was opposed to these demands. The strike by Railway employees added to the atmosphere of labour unrest. It also raised issues like rights of the workers and whether employees of essential services should adopt measures like strikes.

The government declared the strike illegal, arresting leaders and deploying the territorial army to protect railway tracks. The strike was called off after twenty days without any settlement.

## Conflict with Judiciary

The government and the ruling party had differences with the judiciary. The Supreme Court said the Parliament could not abridge Fundamental Rights or curtail the right to property. The Parliament amended the Constitution saying it could abridge Fundamental Rights for giving effect to Directive Principles, but the Supreme Court rejected this provision also, leading to a crisis. The Court gave a decision in the Kesavananda Bharati Case that there are some basic features of the Constitution and the Parliament cannot amend these features.

Tensions between the judiciary and executive further escalated when the government superseded three judges to appoint Justice A. N. Ray as Chief Justice of India after the Keshavananda Bharati case in 1973. The appointment became politically controversial because all the three judges who were superseded had given rulings against the stand of the government. This further mixed up constitutional interpretations and political ideologies. The climax of the confrontation was of course the ruling of the High Court declaring Indira Gandhi’s election invalid.

## Declaration of Emergency

On June 12, 1975, the Allahabad High Court declared Indira Gandhi's 1971 Lok Sabha election invalid, based on an election petition filed by Raj Narain, who had challenged her election, alleging she had used government servants in her campaign. This meant she was no longer an MP and could not remain Prime Minister unless re-elected within six months. On June 24, the Supreme Court granted her a partial stay, allowing her to remain an MP but not participate in Lok Sabha proceedings until her appeal was decided.

## Crisis and Response

The opposition parties, led by Jayaprakash Narayan, demanded Indira Gandhi's resignation and organized a demonstration in Delhi on June 25, 1975. Jayaprakash announced a nationwide satyagraha for her resignation and asked the army, the police and government employees not to obey “illegal and immoral orders”. This threatened to bring the government to a standstill. The political mood of the country had turned against the Congress.

The government declared a state of emergency on June 25, 1975, citing a threat of internal disturbances and invoking Article 352 of the Constitution. The government stated that a grave crisis had arisen which made the proclamation of a state of emergency necessary. Once an emergency is proclaimed, the federal distribution of powers remains practically suspended and all the powers are concentrated in the hands of the union government. Secondly, the government also gets the power to curtail or restrict all or any of the Fundamental Rights during the emergency.

On the night of June 25, 1975, the Prime Minister recommended the imposition of Emergency to President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, who issued the proclamation immediately. Electricity to major newspaper offices was disconnected, and opposition leaders and workers were arrested. The Cabinet was informed about it at a special meeting at 6 a.m. on June 26, after all this had taken place.

## Consequences

The Emergency abruptly halted agitations, banned strikes, jailed opposition leaders, and created a tense political atmosphere. The government suspended freedom of the press, implementing press censorship requiring prior approval for all published material. The government banned Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Jamait-e-Islami, citing social and communal disharmony. Protests, strikes, and public agitations were disallowed. Citizens' Fundamental Rights were suspended, including the right to seek judicial redress for their restoration.

The government extensively used preventive detention, arresting individuals not for committed offenses but on the apprehension they might commit one. Political workers arrested under preventive detention acts could not challenge their arrest through habeas corpus petitions. Although several High Courts entertained habeas corpus petitions, the Supreme Court in April 1976 overruled the High Courts and accepted the government’s plea. It meant that during Emergency the government could take away the citizen’s right to life and liberty. This judgment closed the doors of judiciary for the citizens and is regarded as one of the most controversial judgments of the Supreme Court.

Many political workers who were not arrested in the first wave, went ‘underground’ and organised protests against the government. Newspapers like the Indian Express and the Statesman protested against censorship by leaving blank spaces where news items had been censored. Magazines like the Seminar and the Mainstream chose to close down rather than submit to censorship. Many journalists were arrested for writing against the Emergency. Many underground newsletters and leaflets were published to bypass censorship. Kannada writer Shivarama Karanth, awarded with Padma Bhushan, and Hindi writer Fanishwarnath Renu, awarded with Padma Shri, returned their awards in protest against the suspension of democracy. By and large, though, such open acts of defiance and resistance were rare.

The Parliament also brought in many new changes to the Constitution. An amendment was made declaring that elections of Prime Minister, President and Vice-President could not be challenged in the Court. The forty-second amendment was also passed during the Emergency, which consisted of a series of changes in many parts of the Constitution. Among the various changes made by this amendment, one was that the duration of the legislatures in the country was extended from five to six years. This change was not only for the Emergency period, but was intended to be of a permanent nature. Besides this, during an Emergency, elections can be postponed by one year.

## Controversies Regarding Emergency

The Emergency remains a controversial period due to differing views on its necessity, the government's suspension of democratic functioning using constitutional powers, "excesses" committed during the Emergency, and varying assessments of the lessons of Emergency for democracy in India.

### Was the Emergency Necessary?

The Constitution simply mentioned ‘internal disturbances’ as the reason for declaring Emergency. The government argued that in a democracy, the opposition parties must allow the elected ruling party to govern according to its policies. Supporters of Indira Gandhi also held that in a democracy, you cannot continuously have extra-parliamentary politics targeting the government. This leads to instability and distracts the administration from its routine task of ensuring development. Indira Gandhi wrote in a letter to the Shah Commission that subversive forces were trying to obstruct the progressive programmes of the government and were attempting to dislodge her from power through extra-constitutional means.

Some other parties, like the CPI that continued to back the Congress during the Emergency, also believed that there was an international conspiracy against the unity of India. It believed that in such circumstances some restrictions on agitations were justified.

On the other hand, the critics of the Emergency argued that ever since the freedom movement, Indian politics had a history of popular struggles. JP and many other opposition leaders felt that in a democracy, people had the right to publicly protest against the government. There was no need to suspend democratic functioning and use draconian measures like the Emergency for that. The threat was not to the unity and integrity of the country but to the ruling party and to the Prime Minister herself. The critics say that Indira Gandhi misused a constitutional provision meant for saving the country to save her personal power.

### What Happened During Emergency?

The actual implementation of the Emergency is another contentious issue. The government said that it wanted to use the Emergency to bring law and order, restore efficiency, and above all, implement the pro-poor welfare programmes. For this purpose, the government led by Indira Gandhi announced a twenty-point programme and declared its determination to implement this programme. Critics of Emergency point out that most of these promises by the government remained unfulfilled, that these were simply meant to divert attention from the excesses that were taking place.

The Shah Commission estimated that nearly one lakh eleven thousand people were arrested under preventive detention laws. Severe restrictions were put on the press, sometimes without proper legal sanctions. There were other and more serious allegations regarding the exercise of governmental power by people who held no official position. Sanjay Gandhi, the Prime Minister’s younger son, did not hold any official position at the time. Yet, he gained control over the administration and allegedly interfered in the functioning of the government. His role in the demolitions and forced sterilisation in Delhi became very controversial.

Apart from the arrests of political workers and the restrictions on the press, the Emergency directly affected lives of common people in many cases. Torture and custodial deaths occurred during the Emergency; arbitrary relocation of poor people also took place; and over-enthusiasm about population control led to cases of compulsory sterilisation.

### Lessons of the Emergency

The Emergency highlighted both the weaknesses and strengths of India’s democracy. Despite some observers believing India ceased to be democratic during the Emergency, normal democratic functioning resumed quickly.

Secondly, ambiguities regarding the Emergency provision in the Constitution were rectified. "Internal" Emergency can now be proclaimed only on the grounds of "armed rebellion," and the President must receive written advice from the Union Cabinet.

Thirdly, the Emergency increased awareness of civil liberties. The Courts, too, have taken an active role after the Emergency in protecting the civil liberties of the individuals. Many civil liberties organizations formed after this experience.

However, critical issues remain unresolved. There is a tension between the routine functioning of a democratic government and continuous political protests. What is the correct balance between the two? Should citizens have full freedom to protest, or should there be limits?

Secondly, the actual implementation of the Emergency rule took place through the police and the administration. These institutions could not function independently. They were turned into political instruments of the ruling party and according to the Shah Commission Report, the administration and the police became vulnerable to political pressures.

## Politics After Emergency

The most valuable and lasting lesson of the Emergency was learnt as soon as the Emergency was over and the Lok Sabha elections were announced. The 1977 elections turned into a referendum on the experience of the Emergency, at least in north India where the impact of the Emergency was felt most strongly. The opposition fought the election on the slogan of ‘save democracy’. The people’s verdict was decisively against the Emergency.

### Lok Sabha Elections, 1977

In January 1977, the government decided to hold elections after eighteen months of Emergency. All leaders and activists were released from jails. Elections were held in March 1977. The major opposition parties formed a new party, known as the Janata Party. The new party accepted the leadership of Jayaprakash Narayan. Some leaders of the Congress who were opposed to the Emergency also joined this new party. Some other Congress leaders also came out and formed a separate party under the leadership of Jagjivan Ram. This party named as Congress for Democracy, later merged with the Janata Party.

The Janata Party made this election into a referendum on the Emergency. The formation of the Janata Party also ensured that non-Congress votes would not be divided. The Congress could win only 154 seats in the Lok Sabha. The Janata Party and its allies won 330 out of the 542 seats in the Lok Sabha. In north India, it was a massive electoral wave against the Congress. The Congress lost in every constituency in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana and the Punjab. Indira Gandhi was defeated from Rae Bareli, as was her son Sanjay Gandhi from Amethi.

If you look at the map showing the result of this election, you will notice that Congress did not lose elections all over the country. It retained many seats in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Orissa and virtually swept through the southern States. There are many reasons for this. The forced relocation and displacements, the forced sterilisations, were mostly concentrated in the northern States. The middle castes from north India were beginning to move away from the Congress and the Janata party became a platform for many of these sections to come together.

### Janata Government

The Janata Party government that came to power after the 1977 elections was far from cohesive. After the election, there was stiff competition among three leaders for the post of Prime Minister – Morarji Desai, Charan Singh, leader of the Bharatiya Lok Dal and a farmers’ leader from UP; and Jagjivan Ram. Eventually Morarji Desai became the Prime Minister but that did not bring the power struggle within the party to an end.

The opposition to Emergency could keep the Janata Party together only for a while. Its critics felt that the Janata Party lacked direction, leadership, and a common programme. The Janata Party government could not bring about a fundamental change in policies from those pursued by the Congress. The Janata Party split and the government which was led by Morarji Desai lost its majority in less than 18 months. Another government headed by Charan Singh was formed on the assurance of the support of the Congress party. The Congress party later decided to withdraw its support with the result that the Charan Singh government could remain in power for just about four months. Fresh Lok Sabha elections were held in January 1980 in which the Janata Party suffered a comprehensive defeat, especially in north India where it had swept the polls in 1977. Congress party led by Indira Gandhi nearly repeated its great victory in 1971. It won 353 seats and came back to power.

### Legacy

Between the elections of 1977 and 1980 the party system had changed dramatically. Since 1969, the Congress party had starting shedding its character as an umbrella party which accommodated leaders and workers of different ideological dispensations and view points. The Congress party now identified itself with a particular ideology, claiming to be the only socialist and pro-poor party. Other opposition parties relied more and more on what is known in Indian politics as ‘non-Congressism’. They also realised the need to avoid a division of non-Congress votes in the election.

In an indirect manner the issue of welfare of the backward castes also began to dominate politics since 1977. As we saw above, the results of 1977 elections were at least partly due to a shift among the backward castes of north India. Following the Lok Sabha elections, many states also held Assembly elections in 1977. Again, the northern States elected non-Congress governments in which the leaders of the backward castes played an important role.

The Emergency and the period around it can be described as a period of constitutional crisis because it had its origins in the constitutional battle over the jurisdiction of the Parliament and the judiciary. On the other hand, it was also a period of political crisis. Another critical issue that emerged during this period was the role and extent of mass protests in a parliamentary democracy.
