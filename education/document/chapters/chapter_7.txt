Three decades after Independence, the people were beginning to 
get impatient. Their unease expressed itself in various forms. In the 
previous chapter, we have already gone through the story of electoral 
upheavals and political crisis. Yet that was not the only form in which 
popular discontent expressed itself. In the 1970s, diverse social groups 
like women, students, Dalits and farmers felt that democratic politics did 
not address their needs and demands. Therefore, they came together 
under the banner of various social organisations to voice their demands. 
These assertions marked the rise of popular movements or new social 
movements in Indian politics.
In this chapter we trace the journey of some of the popular movements 
that developed after the 1970s in order to understand:
• 
what are popular movements?
• 
which sections of Indian society have they mobilised? 
• 
what is the main agenda of these movements?
• 
what role do they play in a democratic set up like ours?

Nature o  popular movements
Take a look at the opening image of this chapter. What do you see 
there? Villagers have literally embraced the trees. Are they playing 
some game? Or participating in some ritual or festival? Not really. The 
image here depicts a very unusual form of collective action in which 
men and women from a village in what is now Uttarakhand were 
engaged in early 1973. These villagers were protesting against the 
practices of commercial logging that the government had permitted. 
They used a novel tactic for their protest –  that of hugging the trees 
to prevent them from being cut down. These protests marked the 
beginning of a world-famous environmental movement in our country 
– the Chipko movement. 
Chipko movement
The movement began in two or three villages of Uttarakhand when the 
forest department refused permission to the villagers to fell ash trees 
for making agricultural tools. However, the forest department allotted 
the same patch of land to a sports manufacturer for commercial 
use. This enraged the villagers and they protested against the move 
of the government. The struggle soon spread across many parts of 
the Uttarakhand region. Larger issues of ecological and economic 
exploitation of the region were raised. The villagers demanded that 
no forest-exploiting contracts should be given to outsiders and local 
communities should have effective control over natural resources 
like land, water and forests. They wanted the government to provide 
low cost materials to small industries and ensure development of 
Fascinating! 
But I wonder how it 
relates to the history of 
politics.

the region without disturbing the ecological balance. The movement 
took up economic issues of landless forest workers and asked for 
guarantees of minimum wage. 
Women’s active participation in the Chipko agitation was a very 
novel aspect of the movement. The forest contractors of the region 
usually doubled up as suppliers of alcohol to men. Women held 
sustained agitations against the habit of alcoholism and broadened the 
agenda of the movement to cover other social issues. The movement 
achieved a victory  when the government issued a ban on felling of 
trees in the Himalayan regions for fifteen years, until the green cover 
was fully restored. But more than that, the Chipko movement, which 
started over a single issue, became a symbol of many such popular 
movements emerging in different parts of the country during the 1970s 
and later. In this chapter we shall study some of these movements. 
Party based movements
Popular movements may take the form of social movements or political 
movements and there is often an overlap between the two.  The 
nationalist movement, for example, was mainly a political movement. 
But we also know that deliberations on social and economic issues 
during the colonial period gave rise to independent social movements 
like the anti-caste movement, the kisan sabhas and the trade union 
movement in early twentieth century. These movements raised issues 
related to some underlying social conflicts.  
Some of these movements continued in the post-independence 
period as well. Trade union movement had a strong presence among 
industrial workers in major cities like Mumbai, Kolkata and Kanpur. 
All major political parties established their own trade unions for 
mobilising these sections of workers. Peasants in the Telangana 
region of Andhra Pradesh organised massive agitations under the 
leadership of Communist parties in the early years of independence 
and demanded redistribution of land to cultivators. Peasants and 
agricultural labourers in parts of Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, 
Bihar and adjoining areas continued their agitations under 
the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist workers; who were 
known as the Naxalites (you have already read about the 
Naxalite movement in the last chapter). The peasants’ 
and the workers’ movements mainly focussed on issues of 
economic injustice and inequality.
These movements did not participate in elections 
formally. And yet they retained connections with political 
parties, as many participants in these movements, as 
individuals and as organisations, were actively associated 
with parties. These links ensured a better representation of 
the demands of diverse social sections in party politics. 
I don’t get it. How can you do 
politics without a party?

Non-party movements
In the 1970s and 1980s, many sections of the society became 
disillusioned with the functioning of political parties. Failure of 
the Janata experiment and the resulting political instability were 
the immediate causes. But in the long run the disillusionment 
was also about economic policies of the state. The model of 
planned development that we adopted after Independence 
was based on twin goals of growth and distribution. You have 
read about it in Chapter Three. In spite of the impressive 
growth in many sectors of economy in the first twenty years 
of independence, poverty and inequalities persisted on a large 
scale. Benefits of economic growth did not reach evenly to all 
sections of society. Existing social inequalities like caste and 
gender sharpened and complicated the issues of poverty in many 
ways. There also existed a gulf between the urban-industrial 
sector and the rural agrarian sector. A sense of injustice and 
deprivation grew among different groups. 
Many of the politically active groups lost faith in existing 
democratic institutions and electoral politics. They therefore 
chose to step outside of party politics and engage in mass 
mobilisation for registering their protests. Students and young 
political activists from various sections of the society were in 
the forefront in organising the marginalised sections such as 
Dalits and Adivasis. The middle class young activists launched 
service organisations and constructive programmes among 
rural poor.  Because of the voluntary nature of their social work, 
many of these organisations came to be known as voluntary 
organisations or voluntary sector organisations.
These voluntary organisations chose to remain outside 
party politics. They did not contest elections at the local or 
regional level nor did they support any one political party. Most 
of these groups believed in politics and wanted to participate in 
it, but not through political parties. Hence, these organisations 
were called ‘non-party political formations’. They hoped that 
direct and active participation by local groups of citizens would 
be more effective in resolving local issues than political parties. 
It was also hoped that direct participation by people will reform 
the nature of democratic government. 
Such voluntary sector organisations still continue their 
work in rural and urban areas. However, their nature has 
changed. Of late many of these organisations are funded by 
external agencies including international service agencies. The 
ideal of local initiatives is weakened as a result of availability of 
external funds on a large scale to these organisations.
Popular movements have inspired artistic production like these posters. 
The three posters (from Top to Bottom) are from a campaign against a Coca 
Cola plant, agitation against a highway and Save Periyar river movement.

Dalit Panthers
Read this poem by well-known Marathi poet Namdeo Dhasal. Do you 
know who these ‘pilgrims of darkness’ in this poem are and who the 
‘sunflower-giving fakir’ was that blessed them? The pilgrims were the 
Dalit communities who had experienced brutal caste injustices for a 
long time in our society and the poet is referring to Dr. Ambedkar as 
their liberator. Dalit poets in Maharashtra wrote many such poems 
during the decade of seventies.  These poems were expressions of 
anguish that the Dalit masses continued to face even after twenty 
years of independence. But they were also full of hope for the future, a 
future that Dalit groups wished to shape for themselves. You are aware 
of Dr. Ambedkar’s vision of socio-economic change and his relentless 
struggle for a dignified future for Dalits outside the Hindu caste-based 
social structure.  It is not surprising that Dr. Ambedkar remains an 
iconic and inspirational figure in much of Dalit liberation writings.
Origins
By the early nineteen seventies, the first generation Dalit graduates, 
especially those living in city slums began to assert themselves from 
various platforms. Dalit Panthers, a militant organisation of the Dalit 
youth, was formed in Maharashtra in 1972 as a part of these assertions. 
In the post-Independence period, Dalit groups were mainly fighting 
against the perpetual caste based inequalities and material injustices 
that the Dalits faced in spite of constitutional guarantees of equality 
and justice. Effective implementation of reservations and other such 
policies of social justice was one of their prominent demands. 
You know that the Indian Constitution abolished the practice 
of untouchability. The government passed laws to that effect in the 
1960s and 1970s. And yet, social discrimination and violence against the 
Namdeo Dhasal 
Turning their backs to the sun, they journeyed through centuries.
Now, now we must refuse to be pilgrims of darkness.
That one, our father, carrying, carrying the darkness is now bent;
Now, now we must lift the burden from his back.
Our blood was spilled for this glorious city
And what we got was the right to eat stones
Now, now we must explode the building that kisses the sky!
After a thousand years we were blessed with sunflower giving fakir;
Now, now, we must like sunflowers turn our faces to the sun.
English translation by Jayant Karve and Eleanor Zelliot of Namdeo Dhasal’s 
Marathi poem in Golpitha.
Has the 
condition of 
Dalits changed much 
since that time? I keep 
reading about atrocities 
against Dalits. Did these 
movements fail? Or is it 
the failure of the entire 
society?

ex-untouchable 
groups 
continued 
in 
various 
ways. Dalit settlements in 
villages continued to be 
set apart from the main 
village. They were denied 
access to common source 
of drinking water. Dalit 
women were dishonoured 
and abused and worst of 
all, Dalits faced collective 
atrocities 
over 
minor, 
symbolic issues of caste 
pride. Legal mechanisms 
proved inadequate to stop 
the economic and social 
oppression of Dalits. On 
the other hand, political 
parties 
supported 
by 
the 
Dalits, 
like 
the 
Republican Party of India, 
were not successful in 
electoral politics. These 
parties always remained 
marginal; had to ally with 
some other party in order 
to win elections and faced 
constant splits. Therefore 
the 
Dalit 
Panthers 
resorted to mass action 
for assertion of Dalits’ 
rights.
Activities
Activities of Dalit Panthers mostly centred around fighting increasing atrocities on Dalits in 
various parts of the State. As a result of sustained agitations on the part of Dalit Panthers 
along with other like minded organisations over the issue of atrocities against Dalits, the 
government passed a comprehensive law in 1989 that provided for rigorous punishment for 
such acts. The larger ideological agenda of the Panthers was to destroy the caste system and 
to build an organisation of all oppressed sections like the landless poor peasants and urban 
industrial workers along with Dalits. 
The movement provided a platform for Dalit educated youth to use their creativity as a 
protest activity. Dalit writers protested against the brutalities of the caste system in their 
numerous autobiographies and other literary works published during this period. These works 
portraying the life experiences of the most downtrodden social sections of Indian society sent 
shock waves in Marathi literary world, made literature more broad based and representative 
of different social sections and initiated contestations in the cultural realm. In the post-
Emergency period, Dalit Panthers got involved in electoral compromises; it also underwent

many splits, which led to its decline. Organisations like the Backward 
and Minority Communities’ Employees Federation (BAMCEF) took 
over this space.
Bharatiya Kisan Union
The social discontent in Indian society since the seventies was 
manifold. Even those sections that partially benefited in the process 
of development had many complaints against the state and political 
parties. Agrarian struggles of the eighties is one such example where 
better off farmers protested against the policies of the state.
Growth
In January 1988, around twenty thousand farmers had gathered in 
the city of Meerut, Uttar Pradesh. They were protesting against the 
government decision to increase electricity rates. The farmers camped 
for about three weeks outside the district collector’s office until their 
demands were fulfilled. It was a very disciplined agitation of the farmers 
and all those days they received regular food supply from the nearby 
villages. The Meerut agitation was seen as a great show of rural power 
–  power of farmer cultivators. These agitating farmers were members 
of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), an organisation of farmers from 
western Uttar Pradesh and Haryana regions. The BKU was one of the 
leading organisations in the farmers’ movement of the eighties.
We have noted in Chapter Three that farmers of Haryana, Punjab 
and western Uttar Pradesh had benefited in the late 1960s from the 
state policies of ‘green revolution’. Sugar and wheat became the main 
cash crops in the region since then. The cash crop market faced a crisis 
in mid-eighties due to the beginning of the process of liberalisation of 
Indian economy. The BKU demanded higher government floor prices 
for sugarcane and wheat, abolition of

restrictions on the inter-state movement 
of farm produce, guaranteed supply of 
electricity at reasonable rates, waiving 
of repayments due on loans to farmers 
and the provision of a government 
pension for farmers. 
Similar demands were made by other 
farmers’ organisations in the country. 
Shetkari Sanghatana of Maharashtra 
declared the farmers’ movement as 
a war of Bharat (symbolising rural, 
agrarian sector) against forces of India 
(urban industrial sector). You have 
already studied in Chapter Three 
that the debate between industry and

     The Hindu, Feb 16, 2005
agriculture has been one of the prominent issues in India’s model of 
development. The same debate came alive once again in the eighties 
when the agricultural sector came under threat due to economic 
policies of liberalisation.
Characteristics
Activities conducted by the BKU to pressurise the state for accepting 
its demands included rallies, demonstrations, sit-ins, and jail bharo 
(courting imprisonment) agitations. These protests involved tens of 
thousands of farmers –  sometimes over a lakh –  from various villages 
in western Uttar Pradesh and adjoining regions. Throughout the 
decade of eighties, the BKU organised massive rallies of these farmers 
in many district headquarters of the State and also at the national 
capital. Another novel aspect of these mobilisations was the use of 
caste linkages of farmers. Most of the BKU members belonged to a 
single community. The organisation used traditional caste panchayats 
of these communities in bringing them together over economic issues. 
In spite of lack of any formal organisation, the BKU could sustain 
itself for a long time because it was based on clan networks among 
its members. Funds, resources and activities of BKU were mobilised 
through these networks.  
Until the early nineties, the BKU distanced itself from all political 
parties. It operated as a pressure group in politics with its strength 
of sheer numbers. The organisation, along with the other farmers’ 
organisations across States, did manage to get some of their economic 
demands accepted. The farmers’ movement became one of the most 
successful social movements of the ’eighties in this respect. The 
success of the movement was an outcome of political bargaining 
powers that its members possessed. The movement was active mainly 
in the prosperous States of the country. Unlike most of the Indian 
farmers who engage in agriculture for subsistence, members of the 
organisations like the 
BKU grew cash crops 
for the market. Like 
the BKU, farmers’ 
organisations across 
States recruited 
their members from 
communities that 
dominated regional 
electoral politics. 
Shetkari Sanghatana 
of Maharashtra 
and Rayata Sangha 
of Karnataka, are 
prominent examples 
of such organisations 
of the farmers. 
I have 
never met anyone 
who says he wishes 
to be a farmer. Don’t 
we need farmers in 
the country?

National Fish Workers’ Forum
Do you know that the Indian fishers constitute the second largest fishing population 
in the world? Both in the eastern and the western coastal areas of our country 
hundreds of thousands of families, mainly belonging to the indigenous fishermen 
communities, are engaged in the occupation of fishing. These fish workers’ lives 
were threatened in a major way when the government permitted entry to mechanised 
trawlers and technologies like bottom trawling for large-scale harvest of fish in the 
Indian seas. Throughout the seventies and eighties, local fish workers’ organisations 
fought with the State governments over the issues of their livelihood. Fisheries being 
a State subject, the fish workers were mostly mobilised at the regional level. 
With the coming of policies of economic liberalisation in and around the mid ’eighties, 
these organisations were compelled to come together on a national level platform- 
the NFF or National Fishworkers’ Forum. Fish workers from Kerala took the main 
responsibility of mobilising fellow workers, including women workers from other 
States. Work of the NFF consolidated when in 1991 it fought its first legal battle with 
the Union government successfully. This was about the government’s deep sea 
fishing policy that opened up India’s waters to large commercial vessels including 
those of the multinational fishing companies. Throughout the nineties the NFF 
fought various legal and public battles with the government. It worked to protect the 
interests of those who rely on fishing for subsistence rather than those who invest 
in the sector for profit. In July 2002, NFF called for a nationwide strike to oppose the 
move of the government to issue licenses to foreign trawlers. The NFF joined hands 
with organisations all over the world for protecting ecology and for protecting lives 
of the fish workers.

Anti-Ar ack Movement
When the BKU was mobilising the farmers of the 
north, an altogether different kind of mobilisation in 
the rural areas was taking shape in the southern State 
of Andhra Pradesh. It was a spontaneous mobilisation 
of women demanding a ban on the sale of alcohol in 
their neighbourhoods.  
Stories 
of 
this 
kind 
appeared in the Telugu press 
almost daily during the two 
months of September and 
October 1992. The name of 
the village would change in 
each case but the story was 
the same. Rural women in 
remote villages from the State 
of Andhra Pradesh fought a 
battle against alcoholism, 
against mafias and against 
the government during this 
period. 
These 
agitations 
shaped what was known as 
the anti-arrack movement in 
the State.

Origins
In a village in the interior of Dubagunta in Nellore district of Andhra 
Pradesh, women had enrolled in the Adult Literacy Drive on a large 
scale in the early nineteen nineties. It is during the discussion in 
the class that women complained of increased consumption of a 
locally brewed alcohol –  arrack –  by men in their families. The habit 
of alcoholism had taken deep roots among the village people and was 
ruining their physical and mental health. It affected the rural economy 
of the region a great deal. Indebtedness grew with increasing scales of 
consumption of alcohol, men remained absent from their jobs and the 
contractors of alcohol engaged in crime for securing their monopoly 
over the arrack trade. Women were the worst sufferers of these ill-
effects of alcohol as it resulted in the collapse of the family economy 
and women had to bear the brunt of violence from the male family 
members, particularly the husband.
Women in Nellore came together 
in spontaneous local initiatives to 
protest against arrack and forced 
closure of the wine shop. The news 
spread fast and women of about 5000 
villages got inspired and met together 
in meetings, passed resolutions for 
imposing prohibition and sent them 
to the District Collector. The arrack 
auctions in Nellore district were 
postponed 17 times. This movement in 
Nellore District slowly spread all over 
the State. 
Linkages
The slogan of the anti-arrack movement was simple — prohibition on 
the sale of arrack. But this simple demand touched upon larger social, 
economic and political issues of the region that affected women’s life. 
A close nexus between crime and politics was established around the 
business of arrack. The State government collected huge revenues 
by way of taxes imposed on the sale of arrack and was therefore not 
willing to impose a ban. Groups of local women tried to address these 
complex issues in their agitation against arrack. They also openly 
discussed the issue of domestic violence. Their movement, for the 
first time, provided a platform to discuss private issues of domestic 
violence. Thus, the anti-arrack movement also became part of the 
women’s movement. 
Earlier, women’s groups working on issues of domestic violence, 
the custom of dowry, sexual abuse at work and public places were 
active mainly among urban middle class women in different parts of 
the country. Their work led to a realisation that issues of injustice

to women and of gender inequalities 
were complicated in nature. During 
the decade of the eighties women’s 
movement focused on issues of sexual 
violence against women –  within the 
family and outside. These groups ran a 
campaign against the system of dowry 
and demanded personal and property 
laws based on the norms of gender 
equality.
These campaigns contributed a great 
deal in increasing overall social awareness 
about women’s questions. Focus of the 
women’s movement gradually shifted from 
legal reforms to open social confrontations 
like the one we discussed above. As a 
result the movement made demands of 
equal representation to women in politics 
during the nineties. We know that 73rd 
and 74th amendments have granted 
reservations to women in local level 
political offices. Demands for extending 
similar reservations in State and Central 
legislatures have also been made. A 
constitution amendment bill to this effect 
has been proposed but has not received 
enough support from the Parliament 
yet. Main opposition to the bill has come 
from groups, including some women’s 
groups, who are insisting on a separate 
quota for Dalit and OBC women within 
the proposed women’s quota in higher 
political offices.

Narmada Bachao Aandolan
Social movements that we discussed so far raised various 
issues about the model of economic development that India 
had adopted at the time of Independence. Chipko movement 
brought out the issue of ecological depletion whereas 
the farmers complained of neglect of agricultural sector. 
Social and material conditions of Dalits led to their mass 
struggles whereas the anti-arrack movement focused on 
the negative fallouts of what was considered development. 
The issue implicit in all these movements was made 
explicit by the movements against displacement caused 
by huge developmental projects. 
Sardar Sarovar Project
An ambitious developmental project was launched 
in the Narmada valley of central India in early 
’eighties. The project consisted of 30 big dams, 135 
medium sized and around 3,000 small dams to be 
constructed on the Narmada and its tributaries 
that flow across three states of Madhya Pradesh, 
Gujarat and Maharashtra. Sardar Sarovar Project 
in Gujarat and the Narmada Sagar Project in 
Madhya Pradesh were two of the most important 
and biggest, multi-purpose dams planned under 
the project. Narmada Bachao Aandolan, a movement to save 
Narmada, opposed the construction of these dams and questioned 
the nature of ongoing developmental projects in the country.
Sardar Sarovar Project is a multipurpose mega-scale dam.  Its 
advocates say that it would benefit huge areas of Gujarat and the 
three adjoining states in terms of availability of drinking water 
and water for irrigation, generation of electricity and increase in 
agricultural production. Many more subsidiary benefits like effective 
flood and drought control in the region were linked to the success of 
this dam. In the process of construction of the dam 245 villages from 
these States were expected to get submerged. It required relocation 
of around two and a half lakh people from these villages. Issues of 
relocation and proper rehabilitation of the project-affected people were 
first raised by local activist groups. It was around 1988-89 that the 
issues crystallised under the banner of the NBA –  a loose collective of 
local voluntary organisations.
Debates and struggles

Sarovar Project with larger issues concerning the nature of ongoing 
developmental projects, efficacy of the model of development that

what constituted public interest

that there should be a cost-

analysis 
of 
the 
major developmental projects 
completed in the country so 
far. The movement argued 
that larger social costs of 
the developmental projects 
must be calculated in such 
an 
analysis. 
The 
social 
costs included forced resettlement 
of the project-affected people, a serious loss of 
their means of livelihood and culture and depletion of ecological 
resources. 
Initially the movement demanded proper and just rehabilitation 
of all those who were directly or indirectly affected by the project. The 
movement also questioned the nature of decision-making processes 
that go in the making of mega scale developmental projects. The NBA 
insisted that local communities must have a say in such decisions 
and they should also have effective control over natural resources 
like water, land and forests. The movement also asked why, in a 
democracy, should some people be made to sacrifice for benefiting 
others. All these considerations led the NBA to shift from its initial 
demand for rehabilitation to its position of total opposition to the 
dam.
Arguments and agitations of the movement met vociferous opposition 
in the States benefiting from the project, especially in Gujarat. At the 
same time, the point about 
right 
to 
rehabilitation 
has 
been now recognised by the 
government and the judiciary. 
A 
comprehensive 
National 
Rehabilitation Policy formed 
by the government in 2003 can 
be seen as an achievement of 
the movements like the NBA. 
However, its demand to stop 
the construction of the dam 
was severely criticised by 
many as obstructing the 
process 
of 
development, 
denying access to water and

Court upheld the government’s decision to go ahead with the 
construction of the dam while also instructing to ensure proper 
rehabilitation.
Narmada Bachao Aandolan continued a sustained agitation for 
more than twenty years. It used every available democratic strategy 
to put forward its demands. These included appeals to the judiciary, 
mobilisation of support at the international level, public rallies 
in support of the movement and a revival of forms of Satyagraha 
to convince people about the movement’s position. However, the 
movement could not garner much support among the mainstream 
political parties –  including the opposition parties. In fact, the journey 
of the Narmada Bachao Aandolan depicted a gradual process of 
disjunction between political parties and social movements in Indian 
politics.  By the end of the ’nineties, however, the NBA was not alone. 
There emerged many local groups and movements that challenged the 
logic of large scale developmental projects in their areas. Around this 
time, the NBA became part of a larger alliance of people’s movements 
that are involved in struggles for similar issues in different regions of 
the country.
Le  ons f om popular movements
The history of these popular movements helps us to understand 
better the nature of democratic politics. We have seen that these 
non-party movements are neither sporadic in nature nor are these a 
problem. These movements came up to rectify some problems in the 
functioning of party politics and should be seen as integral part of 
our democratic politics. They represented new social groups whose 
economic and social grievances were not redressed in the realm of 
electoral politics. Popular movements ensured effective representation 
of diverse groups and their demands.  This reduced the possibility of 
deep social conflict and disaffection of these groups from democracy. 
Popular movements suggested new forms of active participation and 
thus broadened the idea of participation in Indian democracy. 
Critics of these movements often argue that collective actions like 
strikes, sit-ins and rallies disrupt the functioning of the government, 
delay decision making and destabilise the routines of democracy. 
Such an argument invites a deeper question: why do these movements 
resort to such assertive forms of action? We have seen in this 
chapter that popular movements have raised legitimate demands of 
the people and have involved large scale participation of citizens. It 
should be noted that the groups mobilised by these movements are 
poor, socially and economically disadvantaged sections of the society 
from marginal social groups. The frequency and the methods used 
by the movements suggest that the routine functioning of democracy 
did not have enough space for the voices of these social groups. That 
Can 
we say that 
movements are 
like laboratories 
of politics? New 
experiments are 
carried out here and 
the successful ones 
are taken up by 
parties.

Movement for Right to Information
The movement for Right to Information (RTI) is 
one of the few recent examples of a movement 
that did succeed in getting the state to accept 
its major demand. The movement started in 
1990, when a mass based organisation called 
the Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan (MKSS) in 
Rajasthan took the initiative in demanding records 
of famine relief work and accounts of labourers. 
The demand was first raised in Bhim Tehsil in a 
very backward region of Rajasthan. The villagers 
asserted their right to information by asking for 
copies of bills and vouchers and names of persons 
on the muster rolls who have been paid wages on 
the construction of schools, dispensaries, small 
dams and community centres. On paper such 
development projects were all completed, but it 
was common knowledge of the villagers that there 
was gross misappropriation of funds. In 1994 and 
1996, the MKSS organised Jan Sunwais or Public 
Hearings, where the administration was asked to 
explain its stand in public. 
The movement had a small success when they 
could force an amendment in the Rajasthan Panchayati Raj Act to permit the 
public to procure certified copies of documents held by the Panchayats. The 
Panchayats were also required to publish on a board and in newspapers the budget, 
accounts, expenditure, policies and beneficiaries. In 1996 MKSS formed National 
Council 
for 
People’s 
Right to Information in 
Delhi to raise RTI to 
the status of a national 
campaign. Prior to that, 
the Consumer Education 
and Research Center, 
the Press Council and 
the Shourie committee 
had proposed a draft 
RTI law. In 2002, a weak 
Freedom of Information 
Act was legislated but 
never came into force. In 
2004 RTI Bill was tabled 
and received presidential 
assent in June 2005.

                                       145  
is perhaps why these groups turned to mass actions and mobilisations 
outside the electoral arena. 
This can be seen in the recent case of the new economic policies. As you 
will read in Chapter Nine, there is a growing consensus among political 
parties over the implementation of these policies. It follows that those 
marginal social groups who may be adversely affected by these policies 
get less and less attention from political parties as well as the media. 
Therefore, any effective protest against these policies involves assertive 
forms of action that are taken up by the popular movements outside the 
framework of political parties.
 Movements are not only about collective assertions or only about 
rallies and protests. They involve a gradual process of coming together of 
people with similar problems, similar demands and similar expectations. 
But then movements are also about making people aware of their rights 
and the expectations that they can have from democratic institutions. 
Social movements in India have been involved in these educative tasks for 
a long time and have thus contributed to expansion of democracy rather 
than causing disruptions. The struggle for the right to information is a 
case in point.
Yet the real life impact of these movements on the nature of public 
policies seems to be very limited. This is partly because most of the 
contemporary movements focus on a single issue and represent the 
interest of one section of society. Thus it becomes possible to ignore 
their reasonable demands. Democratic politics requires a broad alliance 
of various disadvantaged social groups. Such an alliance does not seem 
to be shaping under the leadership of these movements. Political parties 
are required to bring together different sectional interests, but they also 
seem to be unable to do so. Parties do not seem to be taking up issues of 
marginal social groups.  The movements that take up these issues operate 
in a very restrictive manner. The relationship between popular movements 
and political parties has grown weaker over the years, creating a vacuum 
in politics. In the recent years, this has become a major problem in Indian 
politics.

social movements seem to be suffering from .. various characteristics 
which have prevented them from being relevant to the truly oppressed 
and the poor in the form of a solid unified movement of the people. They 
are too fragmented, reactive, ad hocish, providing no comprehensive 
framework of basic social change. Their being anti-this or that (anti-
West, anti-capitalist, anti-development, etc) does not make them any 
more coherent, any more relevant to oppressed and peripheralized 
communities.  — RAJNI KOTHARI
